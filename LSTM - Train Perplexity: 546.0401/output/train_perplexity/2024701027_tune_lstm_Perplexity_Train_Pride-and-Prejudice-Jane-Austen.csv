mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire	64.8508453369140625
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	605.6761474609375000
i am glad you are come back lizzy	70.6220474243164062
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	61.5111465454101562
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	31.9612979888916016
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	35.7193260192871094
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	31.9613132476806641
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	332.6693420410156250
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	35.7193222045898438
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	28.6762046813964844
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	91.0874252319335938
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	276.8266906738281250
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	645.8668823242187500
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	6137.7045898437500000
elizabeth immediately began playing again	26.9410820007324219
just as you please	948.3679199218750000
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	6333.6840820312500000
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	10928.3134765625000000
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	572.7883911132812500
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	70.6220474243164062
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	2132.6386718750000000
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	220.2153930664062500
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	35.7193222045898438
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	145.1334991455078125
and what did she say	1601.2669677734375000
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	89.1176452636718750
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs	99.8149795532226562
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	17.0528278350830078
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	89.1176910400390625
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	175.1156005859375000
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	404.4608154296875000
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	175.1156005859375000
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	251076.9062500000000000
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	52.5503883361816406
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	532.1907348632812500
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	3711.6599121093750000
indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night	31.9613132476806641
everything wore a happier aspect	27034.9179687500000000
bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	28.6762046813964844
that is not very likely our authority was too good	17262.9199218750000000
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	31.9613132476806641
sir william had been delighted with him	89.1176910400390625
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	352.7904357910156250
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	3140.0058593750000000
one of them does	3733.8066406250000000
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	81.0783309936523438

oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson	46311.7382812500000000
if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	205.9094390869140625
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation	26.9410858154296875
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	11530.0908203125000000
what can be the meaning of this	79.9715118408203125
wickham lydia were all forgotten	1816.3068847656250000
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	31.9613132476806641
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	411.4382934570312500
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	2966.5029296875000000
yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases	1949.6517333984375000
true are the others coming out	4590.0205078125000000
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	119.4574203491210938
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	105.1978302001953125
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	52.5503883361816406
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	611.3860473632812500
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states	28.6762046813964844
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	11648.9052734375000000
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	467.9349365234375000
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	9539.8750000000000000
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	57077.4648437500000000
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	35.7193260192871094
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	645.8668823242187500
what would she have said how would she have behaved	36050.3867187500000000
but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	64.8508834838867188
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	35.7193222045898438
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	52.5503883361816406
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	624.1280517578125000
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	1650.8052978515625000
london printed for t egerton military library whitehall	81.0783309936523438
the tête à tête surprised them	25.4574356079101562
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	145.1334228515625000
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	585.2380981445312500
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	193.5674285888671875
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	2146.7236328125000000
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	145.1334228515625000
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	61.5111465454101562
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	396.8338317871093750
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	1677.1704101562500000
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	948.3674316406250000
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	278.8078002929687500
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	20290.7636718750000000
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	52.5503883361816406
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	26.9410858154296875
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	28.6762046813964844
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	94.0184326171875000
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy	629.6641845703125000
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	8000.2065429687500000
not yet replied jane	64.8508453369140625
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better	2099.3530273437500000
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said	1179.0991210937500000
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	329.2416687011718750
it was as follows	187.8594207763671875
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him	642.5254516601562500
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	15987.0000000000000000
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	467.9349365234375000
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	28.6762046813964844
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	10771.2460937500000000
see <file name> or <file name> <url> or <url>	3497.9924316406250000
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	28.6762046813964844
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	1761.7028808593750000
from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	4173.7719726562500000
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	106.2116012573242188
indeed i have sir was her answer	106.2116012573242188
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	31.9613132476806641
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	7573.5839843750000000
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	94397.4843750000000000
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	55.7868804931640625
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	105.1978302001953125
and do you impute it to either of those	26.9410858154296875
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	3163.9062500000000000
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	2503.0502929687500000
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	26.9410724639892578
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	3281.3186035156250000
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	55.7868804931640625
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	32603.3378906250000000
i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true	220.8833007812500000
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	106.6428222656250000
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	187.8594207763671875
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been	70.6220474243164062
yes or i will never see her again	31.9613132476806641
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	99.8149795532226562
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	37436.9570312500000000
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	388.6561889648437500
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	94.0184326171875000
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	914.5310058593750000
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	26.9410858154296875
mrs hurst thought the same and added	2203.6477050781250000
yet why did he come	3494.5251464843750000
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	367.9266662597656250
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	35.7193222045898438
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	8119.4829101562500000
were questions with which she amused herself	81134.4140625000000000
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend	413.4829406738281250
mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all	94.0183868408203125
at length the parsonage was discernible	31.9613132476806641
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	939.5426025390625000
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point	5418.4995117187500000
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	9179.6855468750000000
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest	104.4672164916992188
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	2531.9482421875000000
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	482032.4687500000000000
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	55.7868804931640625
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	1099.7404785156250000
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	35.7193222045898438
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	81.0783309936523438
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	6654.3574218750000000
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	3156.1008300781250000
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	4568.8173828125000000
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	106.6428222656250000
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	105.1978302001953125
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	377.4057922363281250
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	1283.4396972656250000
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	28.6762046813964844
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	939.5426025390625000
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	106.6428222656250000
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	31.9613132476806641
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	104.4672164916992188
my uncle is to send a servant for us	7552.1337890625000000
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	105.1978302001953125
in three volumes	116124.0781250000000000
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	17686.1074218750000000
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	64.8508834838867188
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	98.4429779052734375
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	3749.9362792968750000
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	374.6145324707031250
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm	55.7868804931640625
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying	35.7193222045898438
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	105.1978302001953125
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	28.6761894226074219
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	64.8508453369140625
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	627.4211425781250000
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	70.6220474243164062
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	205.9094390869140625
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	145.1334991455078125
her father lifted up his eyes	5422.4492187500000000
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	230.7145385742187500
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	1887.4215087890625000
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	3286.1286621093750000
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	220.8833923339843750
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	106.2116012573242188
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	123328.2500000000000000
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	106.6428222656250000
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game	187.8594207763671875
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	398.5150451660156250
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	3480.0676269531250000
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	175.1156768798828125
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	106.2116012573242188
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said	17825.3496093750000000
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	1869.9661865234375000
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	31.9613037109375000
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	35.7193260192871094
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	9387.9531250000000000
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	398.5150451660156250
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth	89.1176910400390625
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	914.5310058593750000
cried mrs gardiner	1495.2270507812500000
there was also a postscript to this effect	12685.2421875000000000
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made	28925.9746093750000000
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	3897.3276367187500000
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	55.7868804931640625
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties	13532.6328125000000000
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	1739.3231201171875000
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	4687.4423828125000000
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	725.8837890625000000
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet	35.7193222045898438
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	611.3860473632812500
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	404.4608154296875000
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	6419.1391601562500000
occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	975.6159667968750000
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	1010.6208496093750000
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	35.7193222045898438
do you really think so	28.6762046813964844
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	1059.4130859375000000
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	61.5111465454101562
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	106.2115554809570312
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	17912.5136718750000000
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	3418.1677246093750000
you are severe on us	28342.2128906250000000
good god what is the matter	141.1139526367187500
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	218.0393524169921875
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	1404.8387451171875000
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	28.6761989593505859
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	26.9410858154296875
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	4628.6542968750000000
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	31.9612979888916016
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying	466.3233642578125000
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	404.4608154296875000
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	197.5100555419921875
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	352.7904357910156250
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	10328.9541015625000000
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	23501.3164062500000000
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast	43.2508811950683594
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	35.7193260192871094
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last	850.5672607421875000
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	3873.8049316406250000
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	12261.8310546875000000
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	35.7193222045898438
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	1060.0427246093750000
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable	31.9613132476806641
author jane austen	2687.8918457031250000
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak	377.4050598144531250
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	70.6220474243164062
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	2479.6025390625000000
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love	105.1978302001953125
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	146.8107452392578125
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	2692.3857421875000000
she certainly did not hate him	790.4226684570312500
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty	3827.1806640625000000
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	61.5113449096679688
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	28.6762046813964844
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added	89.1176452636718750
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	26.9410858154296875
release date <date> ebook <hashtag>	303.8398742675781250
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	116449.4609375000000000
are you not diverted	18514.2128906250000000
elizabeth was in agonies	64.8508453369140625
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	325.8623962402343750
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	26.9410820007324219
yes very well i saw them the night before last	1487.9871826171875000
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	31.9613132476806641
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	197.5100555419921875
her own thoughts were employing her	64.8508834838867188
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	218.0393524169921875
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued	329.2416687011718750
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls	26.9410858154296875
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	789.9219360351562500
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation	145.1334991455078125
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	8251.5000000000000000
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	6490.2607421875000000
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	70.6220474243164062
and my mother how is she how are you all	3711.6599121093750000
all was joy and kindness	26.9410858154296875
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	20995.1230468750000000
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	134441.5312500000000000
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	61.5111465454101562
mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	26.9410858154296875
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	6283.7358398437500000
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	481.4356384277343750
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	361.4755554199218750
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	28.6762046813964844
it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	3868.0275878906250000
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	693.1229248046875000
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	89.1176910400390625
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	28.6762046813964844
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	70.6220474243164062
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	5422.4492187500000000
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	31.9613132476806641
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	52.5503883361816406
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	35.7193222045898438
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled	18131.5625000000000000
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe	329.2416687011718750
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	3069.3105468750000000
but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it	218.0393524169921875
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	356.5346679687500000
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	198.8942413330078125
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	106.2116012573242188
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	2806.1440429687500000
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	4081.3623046875000000
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	3624.3447265625000000
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	61.5111465454101562
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	3042.5825195312500000
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	2274.3732910156250000
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home	31.9613132476806641
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	64.8508834838867188
but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	789.9219360351562500
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home	79.9640045166015625
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	3655.6672363281250000
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	377.4057922363281250
they found mr bennet still up	158610.8281250000000000
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him	66.0952377319335938
it was a rational scheme to be sure	367.9266662597656250
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any	5320.9375000000000000
could i expect it to be otherwise	911.4135742187500000
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply	5614.2822265625000000
it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up	66.0952377319335938
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage	35.7193222045898438
oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	325.8623962402343750
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	70.6220474243164062
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	11614.3281250000000000
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1059.4130859375000000
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	9387.9531250000000000
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	35.7193222045898438
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls	91.0874252319335938
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	64.8508834838867188
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	6504.6557617187500000
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	31.9612979888916016
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	99.8149795532226562
how much of good or evil must be done by him	61.5111465454101562
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	3075.5102539062500000
and so was i	56060.8320312500000000
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	873.9728393554687500
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	52.5503883361816406
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	23683.8300781250000000
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	87500.3750000000000000
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	38938.8203125000000000

colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	145.1334228515625000
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	131.9577178955078125
and have you heard from him often	1254.5808105468750000
a great deal more passed at the other table	635.7342529296875000
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	926.9716796875000000
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	11395.4462890625000000
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	70.6220474243164062
they had several children	98.4429321289062500
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it	66448.9218750000000000
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best	27043.9160156250000000
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	81.0783004760742188
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	1456.1846923828125000
said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	69.7465744018554688
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	3793.0429687500000000
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	8251.8779296875000000
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	106.6428222656250000
and men take care that they should	91.1116638183593750
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	38288.5468750000000000
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	1380.6510009765625000
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	547.7366943359375000
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy	3897.3276367187500000
her colour changed and she said no more	198.8943328857421875
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	18629.4433593750000000
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	332.6691284179687500
elizabeth you are not serious now	89.1176910400390625
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	31.9613132476806641
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	15385.4736328125000000
there was no want of discourse	2360.6091308593750000
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	627.4193115234375000
he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	52.5503883361816406
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	10219.9560546875000000
is it possible	12413.6015625000000000
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	1765.4468994140625000
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	26.9410858154296875
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	5418.4995117187500000
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	704.1199340820312500
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	4990.8134765625000000
the first week of their return was soon gone	89.1176910400390625
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment	8264.6679687500000000
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	627.4211425781250000
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	2753.8190917968750000
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below	1055.3100585937500000
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can	70.6220474243164062
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	26.9410858154296875
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	131709.8593750000000000
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	105.1978302001953125
well and what news does it bring good or bad	24315.5937500000000000
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	298.5645141601562500
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	106.2115554809570312
she was ashamed to think how much	197.5100555419921875
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	754.3182983398437500
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her	185632.8125000000000000
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	1532.9838867187500000
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	141.1139526367187500
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	89.1176910400390625

it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing	81.7612075805664062
of what are you talking	70.6220474243164062
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying	2402.8344726562500000
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	35.7193222045898438
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	55.7868804931640625
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	460.7995910644531250
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	13493.9970703125000000
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	7025.4399414062500000
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	361.4755554199218750
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	4505.8750000000000000
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	36236.0703125000000000
i must ask whether you were surprised	460.7995910644531250
but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	26.9410858154296875
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity	642.5254516601562500
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	70.6220779418945312
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	6937.3032226562500000
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	303.8398742675781250
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	141.1139526367187500
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	15341.5625000000000000
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	1621.6060791015625000
no no stay where you are you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye	7552.1337890625000000
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	263.3510131835937500
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	325.8623962402343750
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	50.7507591247558594
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	790.7420043945312500
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	146.8107452392578125
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	607.6289672851562500
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	106.2116012573242188
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	22468.6562500000000000
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all	141.1139526367187500
we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	7430.7812500000000000
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	35.7193222045898438
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party	404.4608154296875000
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	31.9613132476806641
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him	28.6762046813964844
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	467.9349365234375000
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	52.5503883361816406
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	193.5674285888671875
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	131.9577178955078125
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	2024.1120605468750000
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	28.6762046813964844
u s laws alone swamp our small staff	16739.5371093750000000
how acutely did she now feel it	239035.6406250000000000
he seldom appeared really animated	1816.3068847656250000
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num> f<num> this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	104148.2578125000000000
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark	3999.1860351562500000
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	28.6762046813964844
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	7815.8291015625000000
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed	1495.2270507812500000
tis an etiquette i despise said he	2564.8041992187500000
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	61.5111465454101562
jane was distressed	91.0874252319335938
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we	81.0783309936523438
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance	35.7193222045898438
thank you but i always mend my own	175.1156005859375000
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	15877.9033203125000000
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to	4055.1464843750000000
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	35.7193222045898438
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	2141.0266113281250000
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	1625.2910156250000000
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	104.4672164916992188
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	220.8833923339843750
in understanding darcy was the superior	627.4211425781250000
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted	1001.5997314453125000
their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse	105.1978302001953125
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	81.0783767700195312
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	61.5111465454101562
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	719.1730957031250000
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living	653.4589843750000000
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	10080.9218750000000000
why did she come	2914.3598632812500000
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	352.7904357910156250
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	2243.4897460937500000
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	31.9612979888916016
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	20374.7265625000000000
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	26.9410858154296875
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	1622.8692626953125000
oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him	31.9613132476806641
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	98.4429779052734375
can i have the carriage	1582.0601806640625000
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	189.3925781250000000
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out	6155.9941406250000000
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawing room	2058.6821289062500000
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	35021.5351562500000000
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	94.0184783935546875
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	26.9410820007324219
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here	3086.6643066406250000
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	91.0874252319335938
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	28.6762046813964844
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	107018.1015625000000000
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	3367.2507324218750000
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	466.3233642578125000
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	2668.0646972656250000
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite disconcerted	61.5111465454101562
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	948.3679199218750000
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	303.8391113281250000
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	79.9640045166015625
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	126.1849365234375000
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession	1285.5264892578125000
royalty payments must be paid within <num> days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	106.6428222656250000
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable	66.0952682495117188
and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song	28.6784095764160156
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	20615.7812500000000000
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	175.1156005859375000
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	43076.8125000000000000
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	3002.9399414062500000
his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	388.4375305175781250
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	2008.0855712890625000
perhaps we might be deceived	3273.5581054687500000
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	2287.9328613281250000
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	34472.0976562500000000
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming	15389.8916015625000000
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	638.7259521484375000
good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	218.0393524169921875
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	35.7193260192871094
added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	2543.2873535156250000
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	70.6220474243164062
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	304.7229003906250000
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	473.5226135253906250
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	31.9613132476806641
what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is	70.6220474243164062
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing	35.7193222045898438
take whatever you like and get away	24.8882656097412109
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	20969.5488281250000000
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill health	130896.9296875000000000
his character was decided	754.3182983398437500
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	94.0184326171875000
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	1490.4575195312500000
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	8669.0000000000000000
as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	26.9410858154296875
money my uncle	66.0952072143554688
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	70.6220474243164062
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it	52.5503883361816406
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch	1428.0468750000000000
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	187.8594207763671875
for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	4838.4526367187500000
in the hall they parted	1827.2889404296875000
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	6201.9335937500000000
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	220.2153930664062500
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added	98.4429779052734375
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	1848.4500732421875000
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	94.0184326171875000
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	4173.7758789062500000
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	1650.8052978515625000
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	481.4356384277343750
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	10361.0869140625000000
catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	6356.8598632812500000
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	3570.0402832031250000
my dear harriet	901.6865234375000000
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	11477.6269531250000000
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	1710.1345214843750000
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	9061.3769531250000000
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	55.7868804931640625
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	1010.6208496093750000
no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	52.5503883361816406
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	28616.3925781250000000
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	8837.0888671875000000
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	6849.5991210937500000
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	468.9577331542968750
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	1848.4510498046875000
yet it did and even a third	104.4672164916992188
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	307.1393737792968750
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	64.8508453369140625
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	70.6220474243164062
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	4062.5671386718750000
nearly three weeks	14249.4843750000000000
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	6138.1142578125000000
how can you contrive to write so even	35.7193222045898438
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud	98917.8125000000000000
the following sentence with active links to or other immediate access to the full project gutenberg tm license must appear prominently whenever any copy of a project gutenberg tm work any work on which the phrase project gutenberg appears or with which the phrase project gutenberg is associated is accessed displayed performed viewed copied or distributed	55.7868576049804688
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	8096.6416015625000000
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room	3879.2431640625000000
mr wickham began the subject himself	94.0184326171875000
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	590.7156372070312500
oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	31.9613037109375000
i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir	205.9094390869140625
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	35.7193260192871094
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	1099.7404785156250000
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	352.8240966796875000
and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean	52.5503883361816406
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	2038.6455078125000000
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	1187.1909179687500000
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	3798.0129394531250000
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	34280.4765625000000000
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	3189.0251464843750000
lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	7427.3310546875000000
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	261.1198730468750000
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	15176.8750000000000000
this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	11156.1904296875000000
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	61.5111465454101562
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	460.7995910644531250
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth	189.3925781250000000
haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	404.4608154296875000
the girls stared at their father	5088.8017578125000000
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead	215071.0468750000000000
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	61.5111160278320312
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	99.8149795532226562
you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	5644.1791992187500000
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is	9776.8144531250000000
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	61.5111465454101562
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	28.6762046813964844
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	146.8107452392578125
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	629.6641845703125000
she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness	35.7193222045898438
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	4089.5366210937500000
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	26.9410858154296875
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	7080.8183593750000000
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	105.1978302001953125
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	412.7501220703125000
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	939.5426025390625000
their table was superlatively stupid	1756.1824951171875000
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	91.0874252319335938
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	332.6693420410156250
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	28.6761989593505859
i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	8584.6718750000000000
what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	35.7193222045898438
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	218.0392150878906250
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	218.0393524169921875
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	377.4057922363281250
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	8112.4624023437500000
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	66.0952072143554688
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	214.3733673095703125
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state	129.4687500000000000
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	106.2116012573242188
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	15760.5917968750000000
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st	2692.3857421875000000
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	31.9613132476806641
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	3075.5131835937500000
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	106.6428222656250000
nothing that she could say however had any influence	5539.4311523437500000
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	35394.5390625000000000
blame you oh no	22447.8144531250000000
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	99.8149795532226562
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	645.8668823242187500
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	2464.9963378906250000
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	272.3963928222656250
with the officers	172.8976745605468750
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	131.9577178955078125
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	105.1978302001953125
has your governess left you	175.1156005859375000
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	26.9410724639892578
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	590.7156372070312500
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	32.8641128540039062
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	55.7868804931640625
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	572.7883911132812500
there was no arguing upon such a project	618.8817138671875000
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	36676.9921875000000000
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	3459.1726074218750000
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	99.8149795532226562
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them	31049.8574218750000000
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	26.9410858154296875
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	198.8942413330078125
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added	28.6762046813964844
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	26.9410858154296875
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	218.0393524169921875
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	9812.5800781250000000
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	1413.1967773437500000
miss elizabeth bennet	141.1139526367187500
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	31.9613132476806641
we never had any governess	1541.7580566406250000
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	1874.4542236328125000
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	6399.6162109375000000
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	532.1907348632812500
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	645.8668823242187500
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	218.0393524169921875
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been	1743.2336425781250000
miss bennet still looked all amazement	635.7342529296875000
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	220.2153930664062500
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	1622.8685302734375000
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	28.6762046813964844
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton	66.0952072143554688
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	64.8508453369140625
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	352.8240966796875000
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	31.9613132476806641
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	26331.0703125000000000
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	815.7408447265625000
but still he would be her husband	220.2153930664062500
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	175.1156005859375000
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in	1959.9086914062500000
you pay a royalty fee of <num> of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes	2533.3842773437500000
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	16024.2431640625000000
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	1743.2336425781250000
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	94.0184326171875000
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	178871.0468750000000000
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	572.7883911132812500
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	5365.0488281250000000
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person	404.4608154296875000
how despicably have i acted	64.8508453369140625
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	2581.0175781250000000
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there	18937.6894531250000000
no not at all	35.7193374633789062
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	14785.8945312500000000
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	41.4317474365234375
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	28.6762046813964844
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	11311.6416015625000000
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected	2229.5407714843750000
this will not do said elizabeth	377550.7187500000000000
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours c	642.5254516601562500
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	145.1334228515625000
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	31.9613132476806641
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	604.8356933593750000
it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	278.8078002929687500
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	26.9410858154296875
see paragraph <num> c below	15343.7275390625000000
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	7213.0004882812500000
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	35.7193222045898438
they had long wished to see him	18036.1894531250000000
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	89.1176910400390625
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	26.9410858154296875
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	28.6762046813964844
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	27607.6503906250000000
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	26.9410858154296875
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	11598.8417968750000000
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	197.5100555419921875
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	81.0783004760742188
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	1495.2277832031250000
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	1582.0601806640625000
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	4447.2939453125000000
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them	572.7883911132812500
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill	35.7193222045898438
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	17281.3203125000000000
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	55.7868804931640625
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	230.7145385742187500
if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs <num> e<num> through <num> e<num> and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder	54.6355972290039062
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	9781.5986328125000000
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	187.8594207763671875
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	404.4608154296875000
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	13146.4462890625000000
if your master would marry you might see more of him	303.8396911621093750
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	873.9728393554687500
nothing could console and nothing appease her	31.9613132476806641
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	9444.5263671875000000
cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened	638.6016845703125000
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	113679.7968750000000000
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	3791.8132324218750000
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	5399.0327148437500000
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	2287.9328613281250000
mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	16278.5595703125000000
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	72896.6796875000000000
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation	972.1669921875000000
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	79.9640045166015625
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you	55.7868804931640625
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	785.7632446289062500
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	64.8508453369140625
yours sincerely c	719.1730957031250000
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield	248.4912414550781250
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	28842.7851562500000000
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	2838.3408203125000000
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	363.4186401367187500
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other	35.7193260192871094
mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	28.6762046813964844
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	643.7423095703125000
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	24173.6269531250000000
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	5822.9223632812500000
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	28.6761989593505859
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	4038.9287109375000000
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	79.9640045166015625
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	6461.7460937500000000
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	460.7995910644531250
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	1490.4575195312500000
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	239253.2031250000000000
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	91.0874252319335938
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	585.2380981445312500
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	276.8266906738281250
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family	361.4755554199218750
upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know	17.7781181335449219
you are uniformly charming	35694.2578125000000000
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	4280.8056640625000000
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion	130861.2265625000000000
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	28.6762046813964844
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	8829.1210937500000000
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	89.1176910400390625
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	28.6762046813964844
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	4447.2939453125000000
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel	377.4057922363281250
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	396.8338317871093750
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	106.6428222656250000
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	7138.9472656250000000
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	532.1907348632812500
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	94.0184326171875000
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	361.4755554199218750
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	70.6220474243164062
not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	460.7995910644531250
though her manner varied however her determination never did	28.6761989593505859
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	66.0952377319335938
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	315005.4062500000000000
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence	1106.8902587890625000
elizabeth on her side had much to do	2798.0363769531250000
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	263.3510131835937500
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	31.9613132476806641
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	91.0874252319335938
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	35.7193222045898438
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	35.7193222045898438
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	61.5111465454101562
mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	12.4374732971191406
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	89.1176910400390625
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	94.0183868408203125
here she was interrupted again	61.5111160278320312
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	12397.3691406250000000
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	1635.2102050781250000
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works	2188.3500976562500000
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	31.9613132476806641
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	27.4725589752197266
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	94.0184326171875000
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	35.7193222045898438
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her	1099.7404785156250000
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	263.3510131835937500
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	532.1907348632812500
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	70.6220474243164062
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry	503.3793029785156250
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am	79.9640045166015625
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	1743.2336425781250000
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	4942.2363281250000000
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	10814.8486328125000000
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	29824.4921875000000000
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	39721.2500000000000000
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	2333.9006347656250000
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	26.9410858154296875
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections	60168.4140625000000000
others of the party were now applied to	91.0874252319335938
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	300.3427124023437500
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	412.7501220703125000
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	70.6220474243164062
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	10466.3271484375000000
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	31.9613132476806641
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	91.0874252319335938
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	55.7868804931640625
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	35.7193260192871094
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	9323.8349609375000000
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	4723.6616210937500000
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	934.4963989257812500
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	1848.4500732421875000
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	11477.6171875000000000
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	70.6220474243164062
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed	145.1334228515625000
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	106.6428222656250000
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	214.3733673095703125
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	220.8833923339843750
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score	1487.9871826171875000
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	2129.0632324218750000
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	298.5645141601562500
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	31.9612979888916016
his words seemed to imply it	94.0184326171875000
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	141.1139526367187500
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	31.9613132476806641
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	261.1198730468750000
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	31.9613132476806641
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	839.8568725585937500
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	31.9612979888916016
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	189.3925781250000000
my dear niece	1756.1824951171875000
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num> e<num>	1873.6588134765625000
elizabeth coloured and said a little	60.1833610534667969
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said	230.7145385742187500
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	1380.6187744140625000
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	146.8107452392578125
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	10309.8320312500000000
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	1848.4500732421875000
it was to this effect	40572.5312500000000000
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	627.4211425781250000
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him	52.5503883361816406
i hope not	28.6762046813964844
but i was embarrassed	873.9728393554687500
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	873.9728393554687500
said jane as she finished it	6697.3002929687500000
well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	66.0952377319335938
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said	473.5226135253906250
he drew a chair near her	694.8804321289062500
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	396.8338317871093750
on both sides it was only assertion	1601.2669677734375000
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels	629.6641845703125000
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	35.7193260192871094
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	35.7193260192871094
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	31.9613132476806641
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	35.7193222045898438
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her	5852.3007812500000000
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	6486.9809570312500000
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	110.0026321411132812
said her aunt	975.2642822265625000
mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding	55.7868804931640625
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	468.9577331542968750
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	1446.4827880859375000
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	35.7193374633789062
he was silent	278.8078002929687500
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	261.1198730468750000
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	298.5645141601562500
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	55.7868804931640625
but how did he account for it	35.7193374633789062
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	52.5503883361816406
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	547.7366943359375000
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	1325.5476074218750000
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	66.0952072143554688
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	26.9410858154296875
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy	106.6428222656250000
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	28.6762046813964844
very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so	26.9410858154296875
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	2531.9482421875000000
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	7559.1669921875000000
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	1254.5808105468750000
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	6129.0888671875000000
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg tm electronic works	2637.3605957031250000
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	815.7408447265625000
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	1812.0290527343750000
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	514.1390380859375000
he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	89.1176910400390625
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	6162.1909179687500000
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	64.8508453369140625
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	1404.8387451171875000
for the liveliness of your mind i did	35.7193260192871094
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	963.4343872070312500
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	468.9577331542968750
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	3400.6877441406250000
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions	230.7145385742187500
what none of you	7389.0107421875000000
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	1226.2502441406250000
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	52.5503883361816406

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	106.6428222656250000
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	104.4672164916992188
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	11770.3466796875000000
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	2360.6091308593750000
mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read	1154.3806152343750000
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	98.4429779052734375
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	69194.8671875000000000
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	10311.7109375000000000
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	28.6761989593505859
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	56491.5742187500000000
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	2940.7404785156250000
oh yes i understand you perfectly	2018.3582763671875000
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	1055.3100585937500000
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	52.5503883361816406
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	1321.5571289062500000
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued	155279.4843750000000000
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time	26.9410724639892578
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	31985.0820312500000000
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	303.8398742675781250
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	105.1978302001953125

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	61.5111465454101562
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	1399.8229980468750000
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something	3167.2663574218750000
elizabeths courage did not fail her	460.7995910644531250
do not you want to know who has taken it	116.7689971923828125
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	1199.6716308593750000
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west	29179.6582031250000000
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	81127.9218750000000000
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	28.6762046813964844
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	1170.7972412109375000
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest	2687.8918457031250000
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	66.0952072143554688

she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	7950.2973632812500000
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	64.8508453369140625
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	28.6762161254882812
he must be an oddity i think said she	1746.6418457031250000
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	914.9256591796875000
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said	532.1907348632812500
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	28227.2480468750000000
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell	815.7408447265625000
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday	16446.0546875000000000
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	31.9613132476806641
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	6460.4833984375000000
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	300.3427124023437500
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	61.5111465454101562
what is his name	4565.3193359375000000
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	28.6761989593505859
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	1726.5447998046875000
that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	851.7787475585937500
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	2806.1469726562500000
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	28.6762046813964844
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood	1579.0726318359375000
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress	35.7193260192871094
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued	79.9640045166015625
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	972.1669921875000000
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind	1693.9887695312500000
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	276.8266906738281250
you write uncommonly fast	17270.4785156250000000
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	1765.4468994140625000
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	160.9618225097656250
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	939.5426025390625000
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	70.6220474243164062
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	104.4672164916992188
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy	404.4608154296875000
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	55.7868804931640625
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	22752.1621093750000000
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	31.9613037109375000
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	6840.9291992187500000
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	17107.6015625000000000
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	66.0952072143554688
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	47078.9140625000000000
let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	91.0874252319335938
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	26.9410820007324219
she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	99.8149795532226562
his plan did not vary on seeing them	791.3530273437500000
this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever	193.5674285888671875
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married	106.2116012573242188
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	35.7193222045898438
cried his wife impatiently	3735.9506835937500000
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	131.9577178955078125
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him	815.7408447265625000
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	467.9349365234375000
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	220.8833007812500000
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	145.1334991455078125
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	64.8508453369140625
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce	220.8833923339843750
they had frequently been staying with her in town	5572.2548828125000000
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	172.8976745605468750
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	26.9410858154296875
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	64.8508453369140625
no nothing at all	68887.7734375000000000
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	35.7193260192871094
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	89.1176910400390625
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	64.8508834838867188
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	214.3733673095703125
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	2298.0092773437500000
jane was not happy	56.1358604431152344
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise	1816.3068847656250000
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	205.9094390869140625
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	31.9613132476806641
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	139731.0937500000000000
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town	1677.1711425781250000
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	106.6428222656250000
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	2193.9316406250000000
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	26.9410858154296875
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	411.4382934570312500
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	61.5111465454101562
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	851.7787475585937500
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	4553.1752929687500000
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	28.6762046813964844
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	28.6762046813964844
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	1532.9838867187500000
see paragraph <num> e below	220.8833923339843750
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	26.9410858154296875
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	106.2116012573242188
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	55.7868804931640625
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	51.3608970642089844
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	131.9576568603515625
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	27037.9316406250000000
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	66.0952072143554688
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it	276.8266906738281250
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	31.9612979888916016
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	17771.5917968750000000
and quite alone have all her friends left her	26.9410858154296875
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	9516.7939453125000000
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said	81.0783309936523438
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	1413.1967773437500000
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	64.8508453369140625
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	70.6220474243164062
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	590.7156372070312500
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	8467.7792968750000000
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	4872.5517578125000000
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	52.5503883361816406
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	791.3530273437500000
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	91.0874252319335938
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	106.2116012573242188
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	377.4057922363281250
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	31.9613132476806641
what is there of good to be expected	926.9716796875000000
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	106.2116012573242188
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	1743.2336425781250000
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	12362.6816406250000000
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	754.3182983398437500
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	1010.6208496093750000
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	60.1168441772460938
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied	118682.0312500000000000
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied	79.9640045166015625
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	398.5150451660156250
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	2710.5263671875000000
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles	31.9613132476806641
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing	607.6289672851562500
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows	3601.7622070312500000
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	193.5674285888671875
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	197.5100555419921875
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	624.1280517578125000
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	22342.8417968750000000
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well	104.4672164916992188
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business	3075.5102539062500000
a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	2668.0646972656250000
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	55.7868804931640625
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	5453.7680664062500000
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	193.5674285888671875
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	91.0874252319335938
as they went down stairs together charlotte said	1404.8381347656250000
mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	81.0783309936523438
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them	187.8594207763671875
he was on one side of her mother	704.1199340820312500
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	89.1176910400390625
her ease and good spirits increased	304.7229003906250000
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	172.8976745605468750
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	26.9410820007324219
which do you mean	26.9410858154296875
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	28.6762046813964844
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	261.1198730468750000
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	64.8508453369140625
her answer was warmly in his favour	12402.7607421875000000
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	851.7787475585937500
in that case he would return no more	642.5254516601562500
did charlotte dine with you	79.9640045166015625
by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	20.9045257568359375
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small	18147.8750000000000000
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	14603.8125000000000000
a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment	28.6762161254882812
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	4941.5439453125000000
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	64.8508453369140625
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	2479.6025390625000000
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	66.0952377319335938
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	211154.3281250000000000
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	52.5503883361816406
elizabeth almost stared at her	352.8240966796875000
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	31.9613132476806641
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	145.1334991455078125
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	1226.2502441406250000
oh mr collins	35.7193222045898438
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	851.7787475585937500
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	1527.1152343750000000
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	14704.6445312500000000
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	198.8942413330078125
mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense	189.3925781250000000
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration	307.1393737792968750
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	2667.6193847656250000
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	35.7193222045898438
and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins	1179.0705566406250000

the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	947.0506591796875000
she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet	1574.9510498046875000
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	790.7420043945312500
and pray may i ask	131.9576568603515625
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	70.6220474243164062
elizabeth looked surprised	399.4329833984375000
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	141.1139526367187500
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	276.8266906738281250
on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must	36696.3007812500000000
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces	851.7787475585937500
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance	66.0952072143554688
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	604.8356933593750000
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	106.6428222656250000
but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	3601.7622070312500000
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	2188.3500976562500000
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	35.7193222045898438
i have already told her so once by your desire	89.1176910400390625
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	145.1334228515625000
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	64.8508834838867188
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself	460.7995910644531250
oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him	171362.5000000000000000
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned	89.1176452636718750
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to	2610.5700683593750000
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	35.7193222045898438
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	4038.9287109375000000
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	55.7868576049804688
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	91.0874252319335938
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	13242.5439453125000000
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	467.9349365234375000
i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me	28.6761894226074219
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father	1001.6001586914062500
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room	15.1062250137329102
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	31.9613132476806641
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world	106.6428222656250000
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	5572.2548828125000000
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said	2141.0266113281250000
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal	106.6427688598632812
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	61.5111465454101562
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed	934.8845214843750000
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	26.9410858154296875
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	10105.8906250000000000
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	8342.2402343750000000
it was over at last however	198.8942413330078125
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	2020.0346679687500000
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	7096.5693359375000000
my dear sir	193.5674285888671875
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	116.4916610717773438
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you	629.6641845703125000
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	28.6762046813964844
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	28.6762046813964844
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	1303.6914062500000000
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do	55554.4765625000000000
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	35.9423370361328125
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	17356.6699218750000000
he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	645.8668823242187500
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	1542.5589599609375000
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	8205.9921875000000000
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	172.8976745605468750
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	94.0185241699218750
my dear friend	105.1978302001953125
miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	94774.0000000000000000
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	5399.0327148437500000
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	789.9215087890625000
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	218.0393524169921875
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	131.9577178955078125
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this	61.5111465454101562
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	28.6761989593505859
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	1790.4802246093750000

i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	55.7868804931640625
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	278.8078002929687500
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	106.6427688598632812
no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are	645.8668823242187500
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	33162.0859375000000000

her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley	21072.6328125000000000
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	70.6220474243164062

miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice	5718.8750000000000000
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	1785.5965576171875000
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you	73061.9062500000000000
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	1139.5233154296875000
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name	92668.9296875000000000
elizabeth made no answer	398.5150451660156250
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	7673.3310546875000000
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	449.7732849121093750
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	17132.2890625000000000
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	2188.3500976562500000
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	7455.2631835937500000
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	145.1334991455078125
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table	64620.5820312500000000
he made no answer	5853.3720703125000000
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	31.9613132476806641
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	2024.7308349609375000
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	53.5984268188476562
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	790.4223632812500000
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	635.7342529296875000
it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	3825.4250488281250000
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	66.0952072143554688
the envelope itself was likewise full	14632.9355468750000000
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	2519.4470214843750000
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	924.7241210937500000
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	31.9613132476806641
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2333.6657714843750000
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	3156.1008300781250000
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature	278.8078002929687500
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	1710.1345214843750000
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	26.9410858154296875
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	28.6762046813964844
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	35.7193260192871094
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins	70.6220474243164062
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	28.6762046813964844
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	601.9113769531250000
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	64.8508834838867188
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	104.4672164916992188
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	2278.1025390625000000
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy	55.7868804931640625
elizabeth was forced to go	15749.9238281250000000
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	21303.4492187500000000
the supposition did not pain her	131.9577178955078125
she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy	1726.5456542968750000
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks	29282.3847656250000000
invented by m rs bell <num> charlotte street bedford square	590.7156372070312500
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it	789.9215087890625000
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	94.0184326171875000
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility	70.6220474243164062
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane	449.7732849121093750
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	352.8240966796875000
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	4475.6225585937500000
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	2056.9020996093750000
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment	16897.3632812500000000
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy	26.9410858154296875
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	49.7449989318847656
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	104.4672164916992188
what should not you mind	28.6762046813964844
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence	172.8976745605468750
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	28.6762046813964844
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	8047.2744140625000000
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	2203.6477050781250000
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	934.4963989257812500
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	70.6220474243164062
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him	18598.5742187500000000
she could think only of her letter	71.1707763671875000
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	14640.1660156250000000
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	31.9613132476806641
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	303.8396911621093750
cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress	235645.7187500000000000
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could	1111.1589355468750000
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	218.0393524169921875
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	106.2116012573242188
jane was by no means better	106.6429138183593750
she answered him with cold civility	936.8347167968750000
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	896.6298828125000000
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	5934.4970703125000000
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	352.7904357910156250
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	2384.6960449218750000
this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue	28.6762046813964844
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	1393.2058105468750000
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	64854.0156250000000000
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	28.6761989593505859
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	26.9410820007324219
pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family	460.7995910644531250
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world	361.4755554199218750
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	1698.4121093750000000
and she rose as she spoke	3518.6965332031250000
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	352.7904357910156250
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	26.9410858154296875
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	31.9613132476806641
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again	55.7868804931640625
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	35.7193222045898438
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile	79974.2734375000000000
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	6577.3266601562500000
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	985.9684448242187500
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved	3530.7639160156250000
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more	6144.0468750000000000
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	66.0952072143554688
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	1720.5968017578125000
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end	94.0184326171875000
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	55.7868804931640625
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	1677.1711425781250000
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	399.4328002929687500
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	28.6762046813964844
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	2503.0490722656250000
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	5767.4350585937500000
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	1677.1711425781250000
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	300.3427124023437500
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	4131.4848632812500000
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy	8371.2812500000000000
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	300.3427124023437500
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	94.0184326171875000
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility	28.6762046813964844
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise	1607.4868164062500000

they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	616.2952270507812500
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	624.1280517578125000
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within that sum	604.8356933593750000
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	64.8508834838867188
a few weeks he believed	2048.0246582031250000
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	467.9349365234375000
such as vanity and pride	21039.6386718750000000
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	922.7270507812500000
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	1687.9822998046875000
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	329.2416687011718750
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	304.7229003906250000
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	25968.6210937500000000
from mr collins and what can he have to say	52.5503883361816406
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	2298.0092773437500000
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy	104.4672164916992188
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	3176.7951660156250000
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	261.1198730468750000
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	1720.2680664062500000
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	3868.0275878906250000
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	2008.0864257812500000
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	404.4608154296875000
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	14211.0253906250000000
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	278.8078002929687500
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	1541.7587890625000000
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	31.9613037109375000
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	230.7145385742187500
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	922.7270507812500000

it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now	66.0952377319335938
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	3531.8649902343750000
but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	60.3260993957519531
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	70.6220474243164062
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	332.6691284179687500
implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me	198.8942413330078125

he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	2048.0246582031250000
cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	91.0874252319335938
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone	89.1176452636718750

did you go by the village of kympton	102752.9609375000000000
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	503.3793029785156250
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence	2188.3500976562500000
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	473.5226135253906250
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	1635.2102050781250000
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	332.6691284179687500
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2459.5168457031250000
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	1490.4575195312500000

as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do	131.9577178955078125
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	624.1280517578125000
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley	106.2116012573242188
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	7673.3310546875000000
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	4893.9462890625000000

within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	260645.3281250000000000
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	7280.1113281250000000
my dearest lizzy	91.0874252319335938
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	28.6762046813964844
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them	1612.5489501953125000
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	467.9349365234375000
yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor	248.4912414550781250
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	175.1156005859375000
but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	1612.5489501953125000
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	704.1199340820312500
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	33.1081542968750000
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	4628.6542968750000000
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library	363.4186401367187500
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	261.1198730468750000
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	35.7193260192871094
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	790.7420043945312500
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	5453.7739257812500000
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	79.9640045166015625
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	66.0952377319335938
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	177968.2187500000000000
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	28.6762104034423828
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	791.3530273437500000
wickham only shook his head	2081.7407226562500000
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am	197.5100555419921875
mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2479.6037597656250000
to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	146.8107452392578125
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me	89.1176452636718750
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	55.7868804931640625
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend	91.0874252319335938
their reception at home was most kind	5540.6201171875000000
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	638.6016845703125000
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	104.4672164916992188
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in laws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	1413.1967773437500000
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals	27255.2714843750000000
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says	106.6428222656250000
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	193.5674285888671875
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune	52.5503883361816406
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	33562.8476562500000000
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	307.1393737792968750
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	55.7868804931640625
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	2182.5632324218750000
the path just admitted three	26.9410858154296875
if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	26.9410858154296875
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	11635.3691406250000000
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	23.5045394897460938
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	26.9410858154296875
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	1703.5583496093750000
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	39873.7460937500000000
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	99.8149795532226562
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	79.9640045166015625
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	175.1160736083984375
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	145.1334228515625000
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	789.9219360351562500
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	1863.1165771484375000
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	2610.5688476562500000
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself	2153.9443359375000000
i will make no promise of the kind	34773.1953125000000000
oh jane take care	187.8594207763671875
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	70.6220474243164062
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	6275.4770507812500000
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	1451.8262939453125000
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	939.5426025390625000
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful	604.8356933593750000
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	605.6761474609375000
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	9557.8691406250000000
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	7159.0937500000000000
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	28.6762046813964844
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	363.4186401367187500
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	106.6428222656250000
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	947.0506591796875000
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	3807.3657226562500000
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	468.9577331542968750
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	61.5111160278320312
do you prefer reading to cards	1427.2720947265625000
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	31.9613132476806641
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	28.6762046813964844
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	26.9410858154296875
i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself	52.5503883361816406
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	172.0630493164062500
<num> d the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	790.4226684570312500
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	926.9712524414062500
mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	106.6427688598632812
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	105.1978302001953125
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent	23367.6914062500000000
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	352.8240966796875000
lady catherine seemed resigned	1967.6246337890625000
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well	31.9613132476806641
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	413.4829406738281250
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	46719.1835937500000000
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	585.2380981445312500
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	70.6220474243164062
the second began	963.4339599609375000
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	1532.9838867187500000
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	645.8668823242187500
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	303.8398742675781250
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	1250.6643066406250000
no one made any reply	104.4672164916992188
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	982.3726196289062500
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	137957.3125000000000000
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under	31.9613132476806641
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	3958.6071777343750000
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance	16569.4941406250000000
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	64.8508453369140625
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone	3570.0402832031250000
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	64.8508453369140625
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	26.9410858154296875
my dear dear lydia	175.1156768798828125
it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows	1827.2889404296875000
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	20146.2675781250000000
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	5287.8291015625000000
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	413.4829406738281250
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	14466.9951171875000000
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	83113.4609375000000000
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	110080.7734375000000000
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened	611.3860473632812500
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	31.9613037109375000
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	70.6220474243164062
they followed her into the dining parlour	31.9613132476806641
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	52.5503883361816406
sir william did not say much	296649.5000000000000000
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	20615.7812500000000000
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	31.9613037109375000
i had much rather go in the coach	261.1198730468750000
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	145.1334228515625000
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	449.7732849121093750
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate	197.5100555419921875
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	1321.5563964843750000
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	106.2116012573242188
i must not decide on my own performance	141.1139526367187500
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	924.7241210937500000
he shook his head	145.1334991455078125
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	218.0393524169921875
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	24745.0957031250000000
i can guess the subject of your reverie	79.9640045166015625
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	15128.9130859375000000
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	13098.0781250000000000
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	3879.2431640625000000
good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	1635.2102050781250000
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions	35.7193222045898438
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	839.8565063476562500
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	52.5503883361816406
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	3728.9523925781250000
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	175.1156005859375000
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	304.7230529785156250
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	1399.8229980468750000
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	278.8078002929687500
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	329.2416687011718750
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them	2333.6657714843750000
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	98.4429779052734375
he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	18710.0800781250000000
gracechurch street sept <num>	70.6220474243164062
what do you mean	1360.0279541015625000
at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	3325.8637695312500000
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	248.4912414550781250
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	70.6220474243164062
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	106.6428222656250000
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	35.7193222045898438
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly	52.5503883361816406
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	35.7193374633789062
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	1170.7972412109375000
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	55.7868576049804688
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet	3286.1320800781250000
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	643.7423095703125000
however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <url> you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form	4768.0341796875000000
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation	412.7501220703125000
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said	91.0874252319335938
do you certainly leave kent on saturday	638.6016845703125000
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this	2082.4675292968750000
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	790.7420043945312500
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility	4405.3476562500000000
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	2188.3500976562500000
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know	627.4211425781250000
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk	79.9640045166015625
from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	367.9266662597656250
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	23863.8027343750000000
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children	1812.0290527343750000
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	31.9613132476806641
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	145.1334991455078125
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	55.7868804931640625
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	377.4057922363281250
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	466.3235778808593750
that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	1451.8262939453125000
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers	141.1139526367187500
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	99690.4921875000000000
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	398.5150451660156250
does that young lady know mr darcy	94.0184326171875000
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	2402.8354492187500000
she replied in the affirmative	1963.3190917968750000
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	35.7193222045898438
her ladyship was highly incensed	55.7868804931640625
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	15217.6738281250000000
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	9061.3769531250000000
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	10584.0478515625000000
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	52.5503883361816406
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	963.4339599609375000
mr bingley followed his advice	3075.5102539062500000
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	4173.7719726562500000
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	694.8804321289062500
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	2081.7426757812500000
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	28.6762046813964844
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	2819.9602050781250000
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	2167.8203125000000000
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	28.6762046813964844
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	1280.7277832031250000
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	307.1393737792968750
she declared her resolution	3843.5043945312500000
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	68.0150833129882812
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	31.9613132476806641
you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	947.0506591796875000
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	31.9613132476806641
i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	2020.0346679687500000
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	31.9612979888916016
project gutenberg tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u s unless a copyright notice is included	55.7868804931640625
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	70.6220474243164062
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	104.4672164916992188
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed	104.4672164916992188
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	624.1280517578125000
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	1487.9871826171875000
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	272.3963928222656250
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	272.3963928222656250
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	26.9410858154296875
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	352.8240966796875000
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	514.1390380859375000
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	1181.2780761718750000
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	28.6762046813964844
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st	627.4211425781250000
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	172.8976745605468750
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him	642.5254516601562500
she went on	3880.5124511718750000
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family	2823.3696289062500000
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	2337.7866210937500000
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	1698.4128417968750000
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	41033.6445312500000000
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends	303.8396911621093750
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	719.1730957031250000
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will think no more about him	26.9410858154296875
this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	704.1199340820312500
information about the mission of project gutenberg tm	8141.6440429687500000
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	105.1978302001953125
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	89.1176910400390625
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	26.7141361236572266
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	66.0952072143554688
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long	55.7868804931640625
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much	26.9410858154296875
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	850.5672607421875000
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	4568.6772460937500000
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	81.0783309936523438
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	26.9410858154296875
repeated miss bingley	81.0783309936523438
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	31.9612979888916016
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	31.9613132476806641
yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	26.9410858154296875
what could become of mr bingley and jane	52.5503883361816406
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	20004.5136718750000000
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	55.7868804931640625
illustration morning dress	198.8942413330078125
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	99.8149795532226562
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	1179.0705566406250000
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	643.7423095703125000
i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks	411.4382934570312500
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	70.6220474243164062
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	3323.5239257812500000
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	145.1334991455078125
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	175.1156005859375000
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	79.9640045166015625
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	1541.7580566406250000
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again	2270.0803222656250000
yes but he seemed to like his second better	94.0183868408203125
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	61.5111465454101562
elizabeth silently attended her	17101.1445312500000000
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	145.1334991455078125
mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	52.5503883361816406
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	2464.9963378906250000
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	396.8338317871093750
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	467.9349365234375000
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	230.7145385742187500
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	5905.8217773437500000
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	91.0874252319335938
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do	14471.6875000000000000
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	248.4912414550781250
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	460.7995910644531250
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	1612.5168457031250000
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence	79.9640045166015625
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with	1612.5489501953125000
indeed i do not dare	1490.4575195312500000
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before	35.7193260192871094
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	1557.6038818359375000
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	2048.0246582031250000
she dared not even mention that gentleman	1739.3231201171875000
he begged pardon for having displeased her	17371.6230468750000000
you were mr bingleys first choice	8526.4804687500000000
repeated mr bennet	61.5111465454101562
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever	35.7193260192871094
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	8433.2529296875000000
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	1647.9487304687500000
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	1950.0496826171875000
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice	31.9613132476806641
elizabeth was distressed	70.6220474243164062
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	35.7193222045898438
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	70.6220474243164062
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding	914.9256591796875000
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	532.1907348632812500
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	28.6762046813964844
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	146.8107452392578125
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	141.1139526367187500
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	278.8078002929687500
no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	26.9410858154296875
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	31.9612979888916016
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	104.4672164916992188
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	5174.3447265625000000
mr bennet treated the matter differently	19337.7773437500000000
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	141.1139526367187500
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	131.9577178955078125
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	3156.1008300781250000
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	12362.6816406250000000
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	2082.4675292968750000
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	3078.7473144531250000
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeths intimate friend	26.9410820007324219
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	6213.4072265625000000
oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	141.1139526367187500
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	64.8508453369140625
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	33.2063827514648438
there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	94.0184326171875000
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution	460.7995910644531250
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	693.1229248046875000
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	2791.1245117187500000
cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest	810.7636108398437500
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work	629.6641845703125000
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived	220.8833923339843750
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	616.2952270507812500
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	61.5111465454101562
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	18020.7500000000000000
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips	230.7145385742187500
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	98.4429779052734375
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	412.7501220703125000
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	914.5310058593750000
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd	186751.8437500000000000
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	28.6762046813964844
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them	6697.3002929687500000
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	9898.0800781250000000
my dear brother	35.7193222045898438
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	35.7193222045898438
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	26.9410858154296875
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	736.4873046875000000
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	106.2116012573242188
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	105.1978302001953125
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	106.6427688598632812
i should like it beyond any thing	52.5503883361816406
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	9217.6533203125000000
yes she did	791.3530273437500000
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	17773.6250000000000000
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	3531.8688964843750000
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	105.1978302001953125
you are too hasty sir she cried	9093.2851562500000000
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	5580.8276367187500000
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence	26.9410858154296875
yes almost every day	21585.4433593750000000
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num> f<num>	3807.3657226562500000
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	6740.3515625000000000
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	31.9613132476806641
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	91.0874252319335938
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	4078.5688476562500000
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal	6524.1757812500000000
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	31.9613132476806641
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	567.2435913085937500
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	208566.9531250000000000
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	31.9613132476806641
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	145.1334228515625000
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would	81.0783004760742188
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said	70.6220474243164062
these were the contents	460.7995910644531250
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	35.7193374633789062
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	3087.0500488281250000
elizabeth felt janes pleasure	790.4226684570312500
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	28.6761894226074219
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together	27285.5957031250000000
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh	815.7408447265625000
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	39572.0898437500000000
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	985.9684448242187500
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcys	1250.6643066406250000
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	31.9613132476806641
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	218.0393524169921875
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	26.9410858154296875
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	99.8149795532226562
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	64.8508453369140625
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	2858.4982910156250000
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	172.8976745605468750
lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	31.9612979888916016
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	31.9612979888916016
jane shook her head	300.3427124023437500
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	26.9410820007324219
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	263.3508911132812500
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	193.5674285888671875
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	28.6762046813964844
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	79.9640045166015625
he bore it however with admirable calmness	61.5111465454101562
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself	145.1334991455078125
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr darcy	590.7156372070312500
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	32.4028053283691406
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	7455.2705078125000000
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	2048.0246582031250000
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	106.2116012573242188
by the author of sense and sensibility	31.9613132476806641
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <num> e<num>	2193.9316406250000000
and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case	27043.9160156250000000
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible	9043.4892578125000000
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	28.6761989593505859
oh where where is my uncle	1072.2895507812500000
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	35.7193222045898438
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	106.6428222656250000
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	66.0952377319335938
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	28.6761989593505859
and have you answered the letter	220.2153930664062500
said he hastily as he opened the door	81.0783309936523438
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	924.7241210937500000
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	6314.2392578125000000
and is this all	6144.0468750000000000
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	28.6761894226074219
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	6460.8715820312500000
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home	975.2642822265625000
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	298.5645141601562500
and you saw him frequently	28.6761989593505859
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	220.2153930664062500
said he as he joined her	248.4912414550781250
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you	52.5503883361816406
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	2501.5253906250000000
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	94.0184326171875000
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	55.7868804931640625
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	412.7501220703125000
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	789.9219360351562500
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	79.9640045166015625
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection	3069.3105468750000000
jane looked at her doubtingly	26.9410858154296875
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	94.0184326171875000
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	516.5437011718750000
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	388.4375305175781250
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	218.0393524169921875
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	13969.9296875000000000
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	276.8266906738281250
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time	166297.2500000000000000
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point	4050.8911132812500000
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	36629.1015625000000000
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	81.0783309936523438
is my father in town	141.1139526367187500
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tms goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come	2081.7416992187500000
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	694.8804321289062500
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	31.9613132476806641
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is <num>	175.1156005859375000
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	26.9410858154296875
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	70.6220474243164062
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west salt lake city ut <num> <num> <num>	26.9410820007324219
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	3902.4790039062500000
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months	198.8942413330078125
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	28.6762046813964844
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet	104150.5390625000000000
the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	7213.0004882812500000
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	1393.2058105468750000
she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	8096.6416015625000000
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	263.3510131835937500
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	1179.0698242187500000
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth	7080.8247070312500000
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	2862.5603027343750000
jane now came up	7362.7670898437500000
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	81.0783309936523438
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	105.1977844238281250
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	396.8338317871093750
cried elizabeth when she had finished	146.8107452392578125
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost	81.0783004760742188
you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	13129.4189453125000000
by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	16912.7109375000000000
charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture	91.0874252319335938
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	105.1978302001953125
very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	28.6762046813964844
yes in conjunction with his friend	7103.9301757812500000
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	24.3179492950439453
cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way	99.8149795532226562
how so how can it affect them	3412.5327148437500000
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	810.7632446289062500
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	52.5503883361816406
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	629.6641845703125000
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	81.0783004760742188
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	94.0184326171875000
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	141.1139526367187500
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	28.6762046813964844
it was then disclosed in the following manner	106.2115554809570312
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home	1710.1345214843750000
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	122920.9062500000000000
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	35.7193222045898438
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said	55.7868804931640625
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	2533.3842773437500000
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	304.7229003906250000
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am	230.7145385742187500
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	64.8508453369140625
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	922.7270507812500000
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both	89.1176910400390625
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation	205.9094390869140625
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	55.7868804931640625
mr collins made his declaration in form	16174.8935546875000000
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil	26.9410820007324219
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	26.9410858154296875
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	106.6428222656250000
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	3897.3276367187500000
darcy mentioned his letter	16284.2275390625000000
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley	1170.7972412109375000
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her	22595.8632812500000000
it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	35.7193222045898438
how can you be smiling so lizzy	31.9613132476806641
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	29578.1777343750000000
it was all pride and insolence	4056.2956542968750000
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther	52.5503883361816406
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject	28.6762046813964844
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	303.8398742675781250
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	99.8149795532226562
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	26.9410858154296875
updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed	263.3510131835937500
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	1371.2838134765625000
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	3860.7158203125000000
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	29487.7128906250000000
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	2602.0334472656250000
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	14788.3779296875000000
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	1884.2148437500000000
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	175.1156005859375000
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	52.5503692626953125
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	106.2116012573242188
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now	66.0952377319335938
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	35.7193222045898438
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	35.7193222045898438
project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers	131.9577178955078125
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	278.8078002929687500
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	26.9410858154296875
his doing so drew her notice	12233.7402343750000000
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	31.9613132476806641
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	64.8508834838867188
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	572.7883911132812500
the letter was to this effect	922.7270507812500000
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	193.5674285888671875
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	4023.0134277343750000
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	412.7501220703125000
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	1324.9409179687500000
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	274872.6250000000000000
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	81.0783309936523438
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	14863.0312500000000000
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	61.5111465454101562
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	94.0184326171875000
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair	16278.5751953125000000
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families	1967.6246337890625000
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	218.0393524169921875
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	28.6762046813964844
what could be the meaning of it	89.1176910400390625
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	2202.2412109375000000
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	146.8107452392578125
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	325.8623962402343750
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite	218.0393524169921875
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	3752.3183593750000000
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	91.0874252319335938
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	98.4429779052734375
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	101.5418930053710938
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases	52.5503883361816406
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	79485.4296875000000000
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	31.9613132476806641
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	41520.4609375000000000
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	4820.7426757812500000
both changed colour one looked white the other red	17032.6523437500000000
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	31.9613132476806641
her reflections were in general satisfactory	1648.4539794921875000
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	13160.7333984375000000
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	35.7193222045898438
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	7534.8320312500000000
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	134351.0468750000000000
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	52.5503883361816406
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	52.5503692626953125
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	26.9410858154296875
but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	35.7193222045898438
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	52.5503883361816406
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	146.8107452392578125
mr bennet replied that he had not	26.9410858154296875
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	52753.6992187500000000
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	4282.1899414062500000
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	35.7193222045898438
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin	28.6762046813964844
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	35.7193260192871094
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	28.6762046813964844
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	35.7193222045898438
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	70.6220474243164062
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	3592.1093750000000000
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	94.0184326171875000
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better	131.9577178955078125
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	638.6016845703125000
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	1790.4802246093750000
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	105.1977844238281250
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	3283.0966796875000000
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	55.7868804931640625
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	3893.9433593750000000
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	31.9613132476806641
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	839.8568725585937500
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	492.8537292480468750
<num> b project gutenberg is a registered trademark	3459.1726074218750000
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	26.9410724639892578
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	14562.4511718750000000
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	52.5503883361816406
perfectly so i thank you	1060.0427246093750000
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus	5321.1713867187500000
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	3156.1008300781250000
this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	198.8942413330078125
sir william only smiled	532.1907348632812500
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	26.9410858154296875
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	2501.5253906250000000
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	27819.8281250000000000
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	1495.2270507812500000
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added	4028.9536132812500000
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	3469.8444824218750000
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	145.1334228515625000
end of the second volume	89.1176910400390625
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	645.8668823242187500
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	31.9613132476806641
other schemes too came into her head	11395.4355468750000000
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	5009.4389648437500000
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	106.6428222656250000
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	653.4587402343750000
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	35.7193222045898438
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	1285.5264892578125000
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	104.4672164916992188
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness	99.8149795532226562
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	55.7868804931640625
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	1866.4768066406250000
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	28.6762046813964844
i should imagine not	188.4648742675781250
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	4637.7211914062500000
<num> a by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg tm electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property trademark copyright agreement	26.9410858154296875
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	94.0184326171875000
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation	6407.0541992187500000
elizabeth was delighted	2008.0864257812500000
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit	172.8976745605468750
when this was done she had a less active part to play	70.6220474243164062
i am dear sir c c	815.7408447265625000
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	1840.7900390625000000
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	46641.0117187500000000
said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	26.9410858154296875
of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	205.9094390869140625
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	263.3510131835937500
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	94.0184326171875000
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	89.1176910400390625
if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	52.5503883361816406
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	104.4672164916992188
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	26.9410858154296875
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	3655.6633300781250000
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	64.8508453369140625
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	197.5100555419921875
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	131.9577178955078125
it was gratitude	79.9640045166015625
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	205.9094390869140625
i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	28.6761894226074219
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	2501.5253906250000000
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	81.0783309936523438
mr bennet protested against any description of finery	89.1176910400390625
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town	230.7145385742187500
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	1058.9332275390625000
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does	611.3860473632812500
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps	263.3508911132812500
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	55.7868576049804688
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	4617.6625976562500000
but what is to be done about pemberley	3189.0949707031250000
the loo table however did not appear	35.7193374633789062
i never heard that it was	31.9613037109375000
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	31.9613132476806641
a man who had felt less might	64.8508453369140625
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	28.6761989593505859
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	4617.6625976562500000
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	2710.5253906250000000
how could you begin	35.7193222045898438
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	460.7995910644531250
said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	35.7193260192871094
but self though it would intrude could not engross her	28.6762046813964844
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	424607.0625000000000000
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	16745.5078125000000000
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	5497.7280273437500000
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused	8342.2402343750000000
i have sir	31.9613132476806641
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said	52.5503883361816406
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	1661.4790039062500000
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	1435.4670410156250000
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	35.7193260192871094
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	635.7342529296875000
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	1495.2270507812500000
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	2687.8918457031250000
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear	605.6761474609375000
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	106.6428222656250000
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	2966.8652343750000000
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	146.8107452392578125
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study	5853.3720703125000000
jamess had made him courteous	10906.5742187500000000
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	251.5515594482421875
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	11515.1572265625000000
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	11952.8984375000000000
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	31.9612979888916016
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks	352.7904357910156250
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	98.4429779052734375
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	1784.0527343750000000
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course	52.5503883361816406
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	31.9613037109375000

indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	35.7193222045898438
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	9749.9238281250000000
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	514.1390380859375000
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	66.0952072143554688
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	193.5674285888671875
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	3735.9506835937500000
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	49866.8593750000000000
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	28.6762046813964844
the foundations principal office is located at <num> melan dr s fairbanks ak <num> but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations	618.8817138671875000
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	98.4429321289062500
i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	1380.6510009765625000
she directly replied	298.5645141601562500
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	141.1139526367187500
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	725.8837890625000000
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character	52.5503883361816406
oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you	791.3530273437500000
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out	460.7995910644531250
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	131.9577178955078125
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	105.1978302001953125
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	16859.3457031250000000
the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	261.1198730468750000
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	106.6427688598632812
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	4754.7021484375000000
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	7138.9472656250000000
in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	214.3733673095703125
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	934.4963989257812500
if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever	315.4041137695312500
illustration a vicarage house	2875.1745605468750000
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	468.9577331542968750
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	1179.0705566406250000
is he married or single	934.4963989257812500
said he smiling	6313.1079101562500000
elizabeth could bear it no longer	272.4421386718750000
you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	468.9577331542968750
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	590.7156372070312500
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	70.6220474243164062
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	26.9410820007324219
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	81.0783309936523438
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	17133.4648437500000000
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered	352.8240966796875000
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	91.0874252319335938
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	187.8594207763671875
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	32130.5800781250000000
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	460.7995910644531250
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	2956.6289062500000000

by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	1490.4575195312500000
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	24432.0488281250000000
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	52.5503883361816406
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out	5479.5068359375000000
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	7159.0937500000000000
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	32054.0644531250000000
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys	914.5310058593750000

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	146.8107452392578125
yes very handsome	197.5100555419921875
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	52.5503883361816406
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	106.6428222656250000
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	94.0184326171875000
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	1060.0432128906250000
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	2610.5700683593750000
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	810.7632446289062500
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	26.9410820007324219
i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	91.0874252319335938
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	1181.2780761718750000
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	367.9266662597656250
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	173612.6406250000000000
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	642.5254516601562500
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	106.6428222656250000
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	200.5009307861328125
mrs collins knew not what to make of him	35.7193222045898438
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	26.9410724639892578
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	98.4429779052734375
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	1886.3570556640625000
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	1380.6503906250000000
as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	91.0874252319335938
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	4348.0776367187500000
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	31.9613132476806641
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange	14452.4199218750000000
you provide in accordance with paragraph <num> f<num> a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <num> days of receipt of the work	33541.4726562500000000
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	939.5426025390625000
she was gone directly	94.0184326171875000
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	31.9613132476806641
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	35.7193222045898438
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	1058.9332275390625000
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia	11073.0683593750000000
is that his design in settling here	26.9410820007324219
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged	8987.0625000000000000
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	4582.6894531250000000
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable	10159.4736328125000000
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she	81.0783309936523438
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	35.7193222045898438
said elizabeth to herself	26.9410820007324219
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	2008.0864257812500000
they were to be off as soon as possible	719.1730957031250000
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long	9812.5800781250000000
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	481.4356384277343750
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	66.0952377319335938
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	377.4057922363281250
well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	50.2590942382812500
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	141.1139526367187500
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	52.5503883361816406
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other	95650.9609375000000000
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	220.2153930664062500
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it	2202.2412109375000000
i am talking of possibilities charles	39425.9687500000000000
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller	1839.6044921875000000
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling	2132.6386718750000000
what is it you mean	198.8942413330078125
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it	105.1978302001953125
that is a failing indeed	5365.0488281250000000
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	8276.9570312500000000
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	901.6865234375000000
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	31.9613132476806641
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	32.0549774169921875
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	193.5674285888671875
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	172.8976745605468750
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	276.8266906738281250
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	79.9640045166015625
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	31.9613132476806641
my dear jane	329.2416687011718750
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said	31.9613132476806641
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at <url>	411.4382934570312500
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	193.5674285888671875
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	31.9613132476806641
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case	5756.7851562500000000
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	94220.6718750000000000
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself	89.1176452636718750
<num> e unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg	4348.0776367187500000
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	13110.4492187500000000
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	4992.5126953125000000
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	8870.3056640625000000
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	49539.8906250000000000
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	31.9613132476806641
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses	28.6762046813964844
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	5497.7221679687500000
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference	26.9410858154296875
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet	1055.3100585937500000
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	261.1198730468750000
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	6867.3833007812500000
but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	35.7193222045898438
said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	388.4375305175781250
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you	413.4829406738281250
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	642.5254516601562500
she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife	29831.0957031250000000
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	7708.7656250000000000
then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	91.0874252319335938
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	248.4912414550781250
can it be possible that he will marry her	131.9577178955078125
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	30.5989131927490234
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	361.4755554199218750
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	28.6762046813964844
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	3135.5561523437500000
elizabeth now began to revive	1687.9822998046875000
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	35.7193222045898438
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	3531.8688964843750000
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	251925.9843750000000000
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	629.6641845703125000
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	514.1390380859375000
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	197.5100555419921875
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	98.4429779052734375
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	27577.9921875000000000
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	2224.9875488281250000
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	31.9613132476806641
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	66.0952072143554688
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy	66.0952377319335938
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	106.2116012573242188
cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	205.9094390869140625
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	5223.2841796875000000
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	1962.5010986328125000
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution	5999.1162109375000000
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	304.7229003906250000
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	358.9292602539062500
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	64.8508453369140625
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	1761.7028808593750000
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	1661.4790039062500000
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	26.9410858154296875
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	106.2115554809570312
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	1334.2836914062500000
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	104.4672164916992188
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs foot stool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <num> per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	4073.4182128906250000
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	2281.8576660156250000
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	106.2116012573242188
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying	3181.4460449218750000
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	2805.8872070312500000
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	106.6428222656250000
i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family	1380.6503906250000000
a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	9643.8359375000000000
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her	466.3235778808593750
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	66.0952377319335938
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	141.1139526367187500
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	218.0392150878906250
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	31.9613132476806641
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	4419.1240234375000000
in what an amiable light does this place him	106.2116012573242188
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	3325.8637695312500000
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	1710.1345214843750000
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do	66.0952072143554688
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	193.5674285888671875
it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think	28.6762046813964844
how nicely we are crammed in	2020.2723388671875000
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	31.9613132476806641
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	70.6220474243164062
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	2281.8576660156250000
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	28.6762046813964844
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	218.0393524169921875
cried miss bingley	52.5503883361816406
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion	70.6220474243164062
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	89.1176910400390625
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets	104.4672164916992188
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	64.8508453369140625
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	26.9410858154296875
i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	31.9613132476806641
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	10947.9462890625000000
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	248.4912414550781250
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	106.6427688598632812
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect	14338.7587890625000000
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	1541.7580566406250000
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	220.2153930664062500
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	52.5503883361816406
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well	26.9410858154296875
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	2201.3925781250000000
