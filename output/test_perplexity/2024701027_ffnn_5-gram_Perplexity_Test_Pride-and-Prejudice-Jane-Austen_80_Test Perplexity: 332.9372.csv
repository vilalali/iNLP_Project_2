i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable every thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely	10524.5410156250000000
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	684.9481201171875000
cried jane what do you mean sir	62.1511306762695312
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	54.0003890991210938
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	16.0079536437988281
to mr bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	9.6214036941528320
certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance	1758.5732421875000000
that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	441.2753906250000000
mr bingley arrived	23.2506504058837891
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	1179.2965087890625000
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	9937.0478515625000000
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table	47.7108535766601562
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land	218.8126831054687500
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	317.1087646484375000
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	26.2900867462158203
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal	68.3752136230468750
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants	3.6040706634521484
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	241.6341857910156250
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it	230.0732879638671875

for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable	180.7769927978515625
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	24.8027629852294922

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	218.6273345947265625
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	75551.2031250000000000
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	446.5741577148437500
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented	2.7075397968292236
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	656.6932373046875000

elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	2.7798082828521729
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals	60612.9765625000000000
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards	4.0474748611450195
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help	1276.6268310546875000
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	33.7629356384277344
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	343.5484924316406250
the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	168.6412658691406250

my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	84.8340301513671875
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas	7715.7670898437500000
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	543.6629028320312500
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	29.6160411834716797
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	1916644.1250000000000000

day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	870.1223144531250000
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	3.4250178337097168

nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	631.6302490234375000

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	280.4620361328125000
to morrow fortnight	2844.3769531250000000
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character	57638.8007812500000000
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys love	64053.3398437500000000
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	17.6127357482910156
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres	5902120.5000000000000000
it became her turn to listen	47.5981597900390625
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	111.2719268798828125
on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	371.1903686523437500
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	204.4323577880859375
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	1197575.5000000000000000
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies	302.9868164062500000
i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education	511.9158020019531250
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	218.3361663818359375
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	16367.8203125000000000
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley	266.4962158203125000
all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	220.6277160644531250
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have	2618.8923339843750000
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	369.3842773437500000
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	6.0426764488220215
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	145.7000732421875000
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	7.7359819412231445
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	232.9570922851562500
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere	22.3279285430908203
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	84136.8906250000000000
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	23054.9589843750000000
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millars regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart	217.0033569335937500
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	24.7089347839355469
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile	12709601.0000000000000000
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	27.3301277160644531
her mind was less difficult to develope	93304.2187500000000000
her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it	154.1671295166015625
mr collins was eloquent in her praise	800.7423706054687500
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	5899.6860351562500000
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	8839.7695312500000000
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	40.9907913208007812
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	6427.6230468750000000
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	4.4213089942932129
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible	3117349.0000000000000000
the next was in these words	5.2652392387390137
mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began	942529.8125000000000000
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in	3287.1381835937500000
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	89.2079467773437500
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	195.9107971191406250
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	299.2399597167968750
why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	3.8358461856842041
he replied and was again silent	126.2525711059570312
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	21.2951393127441406
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	161.2602081298828125
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham	19827642.0000000000000000
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	775.5977783203125000
darcy was fixed in astonishment	1003.5353393554687500
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	132.8349914550781250
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	910.6785278320312500
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	731.1225585937500000
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	121.8162918090820312
oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	421.3905029296875000
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	7.2650909423828125
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen	2766.4116210937500000
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself	1988375.7500000000000000
there was another reason too for her opposition	154.4187469482421875
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little	1213.7974853515625000
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	572.0388793945312500
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he	10.6510219573974609
note project gutenberg also has an html version of this file which includes the original illustrations	9069.8320312500000000
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	27.9313983917236328
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	33.4989204406738281
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	23.1653289794921875
and what is your success	9943169.0000000000000000
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	49.4179420471191406
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	29.0670719146728516
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	232.6331939697265625
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	23887.7128906250000000
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations	885.6967163085937500
she stared coloured doubted and was silent	42.2480697631835938
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow	2038211.3750000000000000
after a short silence the lady first spoke	118.7352828979492188
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	14.9489364624023438
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	13.3135147094726562
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	186.1245574951171875
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	331.9006958007812500
if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse	6.7318906784057617
oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	22.4873180389404297
are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake	82.3718261718750000
when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake	1125.5560302734375000
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	54.8941268920898438
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcys but you shall do as you chuse	6073.5898437500000000
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another	179.6971130371093750
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days journey yes i call it a very easy distance	76.7722473144531250
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	2907.6625976562500000
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair	53.5319404602050781
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	122.3151092529296875
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance	2.7035894393920898
the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful	268.2225036621093750
many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	10.8014993667602539
from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	201.7645111083984375
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days	84.2993698120117188
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began	5415.3588867187500000
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	202.7954254150390625
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	79.7176818847656250
an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	4933.6044921875000000
of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	413.8845520019531250
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	95.3075332641601562
when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister	60.6123008728027344
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling	322.3251647949218750
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well	8197.9980468750000000
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	3.6786634922027588
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out	1117.5063476562500000
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	16.0058002471923828
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	99.6752777099609375
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	19.4595146179199219
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents	9.6902523040771484
yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent	54.0550613403320312
end of vol	15.2165327072143555
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	64335.2617187500000000
lydia laughed and said	748.7037353515625000
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	23648.1289062500000000
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	10.3895111083984375
on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	12.4770803451538086
in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out	338.7239074707031250
cried he turning towards her	27.0013732910156250
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion	75.2040939331054688
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	464.9235229492187500
you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition	407.8867797851562500
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	7.4403696060180664
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me	31.8547458648681641
but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand	3.5472595691680908
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	731.9984741210937500
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	4.7396121025085449
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	188.9880676269531250
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	33.3795471191406250
i am said he with a firm voice	247795.4062500000000000
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	27.5287570953369141
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	4364.4921875000000000
you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	1771.1450195312500000
wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so	112.1615447998046875
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	26.2787151336669922
repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed	88.7494735717773438
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	18.4894733428955078
yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	3808.9020996093750000
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	91.1098785400390625
that he should even speak to her was amazing	16.0752735137939453
that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	10.3443956375122070
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane	317.1106262207031250
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	201.4561004638671875
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	36.1954154968261719
she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy	15.4615879058837891
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	1521.1730957031250000
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions	1.4501745700836182
engraved for no	62.1947708129882812
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her	149.0755462646484375
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	105.1769256591796875
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend	2088.2775878906250000
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	14294.1142578125000000
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	1125.1428222656250000
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	23.9926948547363281
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about	269.8363037109375000
why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you	7.5388369560241699
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	2.8245320320129395
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her	10493.3222656250000000
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation	172.6695404052734375
how could i ever think her like her nephew	19.2553367614746094
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties	24.2560768127441406
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	85.8701324462890625
pride and prejudice	72.0981903076171875
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	127.9253768920898438
the effect was immediate	3.3260099887847900
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	29.9566879272460938
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	370.0154113769531250
and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount	2071706.6250000000000000
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	74.2527313232421875
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	2864.2587890625000000
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk	82.2580032348632812
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	75.6574020385742188
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor	3.8127839565277100
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	198.7123260498046875
said she as she looked in her face	67057.4531250000000000
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship	54.0820808410644531
that you certainly shall	4.5861020088195801
professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	107.7990875244140625
and do you like her	156.9130401611328125
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	18.0651607513427734
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather	56.6122970581054688
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger	514.4499511718750000
dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself	2100.0739746093750000
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	120.7288055419921875
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	417.8096923828125000
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	12580.4042968750000000
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcys looks and behaviour	293.2936401367187500
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	68.1212463378906250
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money	79.7538299560546875
what is he coming home and without poor lydia	117.8447570800781250
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered	2114.7109375000000000
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added	23445.9101562500000000
mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast	173.9541931152343750
it was melancholy to leave her to such society	3.8247699737548828
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time	1395.2215576171875000
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	54.0948448181152344
all field sports were over	305.5692749023437500
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	16404.9199218750000000
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	448.6525878906250000
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	69.6426925659179688
he then said	48.1014099121093750
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received	219583.5312500000000000
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	1041.2272949218750000
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	186.9105987548828125
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable	4.1033549308776855
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish	108.4183120727539062
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long	2020.5480957031250000
mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	1253.6037597656250000
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments	22.8361740112304688
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	6476.4599609375000000
is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject	489.9986877441406250
elizabeth replied that it was	364.6239929199218750
books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings	5490.9213867187500000
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent	110.6476440429687500
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied	34.0446090698242188
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	62.7612266540527344
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me	8433991.0000000000000000
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	30084440.0000000000000000
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	58.6340332031250000
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	28930.2773437500000000
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	219526.3750000000000000
the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	5.6806101799011230
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas	88.9694976806640625
while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	2.9933624267578125
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	253.7114715576171875
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	156.9919128417968750
where is your sister	3.0658013820648193
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	383.8497314453125000
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	162.0628204345703125
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	28.2687263488769531
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	38.7542114257812500
he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting	18.7419738769531250
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there	6.3185815811157227
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate	617.1068115234375000
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter	70.0688858032226562
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	527.8489990234375000
he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	130.6351013183593750
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	58.5053977966308594
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	15.7406415939331055
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear	284.3713378906250000
spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book	16.0353260040283203
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	151.3950500488281250
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth	184.4398345947265625
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	87.5029067993164062
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	12.9763679504394531
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	7.4645476341247559
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	50.6441383361816406
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan	155.6203765869140625
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	1061.3446044921875000
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	36.7671051025390625
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders	129.3691558837890625
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	2279.6218261718750000
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up	783.4044799804687500
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	817948.2500000000000000
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	9672.8779296875000000
his manners are very different from his cousins	1911.0753173828125000
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	295.1829833984375000
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	167.8060607910156250
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it	20.0858135223388672

she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	2207.3381347656250000
louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst	737.1966552734375000
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	326.7382202148437500
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	61629.4648437500000000
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter	1257.7542724609375000

mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton	158.4689941406250000
mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	15429.6142578125000000
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	108.1751937866210938
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	2394.1250000000000000
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	3.4817008972167969
mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	726.4495849609375000
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	36.6527023315429688
that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	5.6939105987548828
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room	1859.1682128906250000
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	1.8978613615036011
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	2477078.7500000000000000
all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young	322.9881286621093750
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed	279.4589538574218750
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	37.2880325317382812
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it	1514.0128173828125000
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	9516309.0000000000000000
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	75.2296676635742188
oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs	377.6920471191406250
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	2705.3781738281250000
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success	17.3998413085937500
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid	377.4705810546875000
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	444.3861999511718750
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	17925.4160156250000000
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	6.1041517257690430
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage	541.0075073242187500
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	23.9017715454101562
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	3291.0402832031250000
this was invitation enough	1000010.6250000000000000
they may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks	57.8694953918457031
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain	31.6199207305908203
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	51.5274581909179688
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes	138.7727050781250000
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	56.1571197509765625
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house	1750.0640869140625000
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was	65.0758666992187500
there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master	33.9639282226562500
i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else	92.0268478393554688
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies	24.9876976013183594
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	713.3115234375000000
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	16.9697170257568359
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you	61.5722427368164062
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said	365.7063293457031250
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	37.7924079895019531
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	18.5592269897460938
but she would not be secure	200.6168518066406250
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	31.6369628906250000
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself	1902.8714599609375000
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	380.8475036621093750
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	1495829.0000000000000000
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	33.5418739318847656
mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again	122.1876296997070312
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford	198.7149810791015625
yes i have had a letter from him by express	4970866.0000000000000000
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business	41342.1054687500000000
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	769.1687011718750000
you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly	402.3241577148437500
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	395.1191711425781250
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	97.4935073852539062
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	124690.4062500000000000
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	1312.2628173828125000
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	5.5542888641357422
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties	8703.1455078125000000
her report was highly favourable	34.1624946594238281
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	46.7213973999023438
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	9.0962171554565430
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	1072.7447509765625000
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	2882.4350585937500000
they were hopeless of remedy	12.8126802444458008
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	32421.6738281250000000
his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	25.1036396026611328
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	4.8325662612915039
cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	2938.5007324218750000
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	951.5772705078125000
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	3723.5722656250000000
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	16882.1582031250000000
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	10704.2451171875000000
mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	95.6424179077148438
you are mistaken i write rather slowly	17.5137424468994141
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	123.6435546875000000
upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age	247.3388824462890625
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	125.6877059936523438
at that moment she cared for no other	7.9915680885314941
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	23.6672058105468750
oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret	225.5157012939453125
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	43.6709976196289062
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	4460540.0000000000000000
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country	32.4936904907226562
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	1605.2891845703125000
mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves	31.5190620422363281
if one could but go to brighton	886.8368530273437500
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	125.5712509155273438
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected	912.0900268554687500
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	3.3557369709014893
mrs reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	6700.6791992187500000
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	1015.9603881835937500
but you how are you	134.7516937255859375
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour	1371.8488769531250000
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	1.1304044723510742
exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	2813037.2500000000000000
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	285.1636657714843750
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	1894.8790283203125000
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease	70.2234497070312500
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner	20.9211845397949219
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	2.3511948585510254
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome	393.6322631835937500
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	20.5258598327636719
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	86.7519378662109375
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	460.9564819335937500
gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	210.9360198974609375
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	10.2056655883789062
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	6.6032552719116211
my dear lizzy	2184.6958007812500000
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	512.8862915039062500
mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces	26.6850166320800781
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves	7.3495841026306152
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it	9.1948070526123047
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	24.4953575134277344
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	9.0471582412719727
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	76.7684783935546875
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	1807.2064208984375000
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	18.6281738281250000
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	82.9002685546875000
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself	12.3652362823486328
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss	3.1638090610504150
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	190.3381347656250000
my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	10335.9199218750000000
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	63.8692092895507812
said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	167.6768035888671875
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	296.5090026855468750
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week	70.4598846435546875
it would be dreadful	6.0817999839782715
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	428.3850402832031250

they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	437.2955627441406250
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	45.5506324768066406
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject	56.4076728820800781
then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen	32.3060913085937500
this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	14.7521333694458008
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	379.1372070312500000
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	13.4859437942504883
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	1507.8992919921875000
she knew not what to think nor how to account for it	58.4771194458007812
oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long	154339.1875000000000000
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come	257.6571960449218750
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	15.8756389617919922
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	163.7602386474609375
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	50.2274360656738281
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	180.9660339355468750
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	22.2705039978027344
the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	541.0648193359375000
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	23.0556087493896484
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	12734.5742187500000000
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters	1.8777757883071899
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	44.5109138488769531
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females	46.9036026000976562
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	2236.3422851562500000
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	1846.1871337890625000
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	21.7636966705322266
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year	38.9169425964355469
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	16508.1718750000000000
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	2.6431326866149902
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	857.5052490234375000
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	55.6320114135742188
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal	403.4763183593750000
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	11.4393911361694336
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	8.4769668579101562
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	663.7052001953125000
lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	340.2932739257812500
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all	1178.6679687500000000
the visit was returned in due form	28.7609310150146484
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying	5142.8881835937500000
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	134.9249114990234375
how should you have liked making sermons	74.2816696166992188
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	11.8715915679931641
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	238.0704345703125000
you begin to comprehend me do you	220.7559967041015625
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	1268.0728759765625000
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	966901888.0000000000000000
sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away	218.3892517089843750
he heard her attentively and then said	469.0684814453125000
can you deny that you have done it	4.8045811653137207
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	11.6855773925781250
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	158.5897827148437500
her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	1286890.6250000000000000
what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy	307.8857116699218750
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	10.7899637222290039
mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	9188.1816406250000000
mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	538.2580566406250000
you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	311.5238952636718750
my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street	953.3530883789062500
and this is always the way with him she added	6.6850018501281738
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us	1740052.3750000000000000
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	453.0731506347656250
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation	18.6458854675292969
darcy said nothing at all	75.3133697509765625
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend	2.3116655349731445
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	156.0012207031250000
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister	109.9356155395507812
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	24.9985218048095703
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	736.0203247070312500
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	526.8509521484375000
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	25.9272327423095703
at night she opened her heart to jane	987.4500122070312500
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	363.0451965332031250
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again	34.1603050231933594
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said	4149438.0000000000000000
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	123604.0078125000000000
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	8.2646083831787109
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	304.5286560058593750
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	10122.4335937500000000
said her mother	16963556.0000000000000000
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes	297.6629943847656250
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	191.5771179199218750
my style of writing is very different from yours	2506.4997558593750000
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	8635261952.0000000000000000
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance	971.6098632812500000
yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him	2231.2517089843750000
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	111.5649337768554688
mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable	24.7379493713378906
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy	265.1193542480468750
when is your next ball to be lizzy	443.1742858886718750
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	19448220.0000000000000000
she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	113490.0000000000000000
her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling	1.8956379890441895
speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	1154.7427978515625000
and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	5.6435213088989258
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting	130.2274169921875000
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with	133.6200714111328125
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	6.2171187400817871
oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	33.2790679931640625
he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	485.1378479003906250
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	5160.9589843750000000
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed	13.3702697753906250
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy	93.6392517089843750
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard	57.8495979309082031
said mr gardiner	111.0684204101562500
<num> c the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works	2.6848940849304199
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	14.9769725799560547
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	3357.6435546875000000
but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	10.3488702774047852
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	624.2450561523437500
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it	78.1831436157226562
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual	39.1051368713378906
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book	3.1903252601623535
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	1210.2442626953125000
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	411.4800720214843750
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	298.6203002929687500
i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united	389.3952026367187500
miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	386.9549560546875000
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	22.2456607818603516
jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	17.8271408081054688
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	1029.2198486328125000
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit <num> c <num> educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service	160.9821624755859375
no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	9.4112844467163086
widely different was the effect of a second perusal	446.2120666503906250
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	21.7509956359863281
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	2367.7600097656250000
mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	68.5331344604492188
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	47.3756866455078125
she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids	6.5934104919433594
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy	5062.9477539062500000
there was no help for it however	10.3176679611206055
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <url>	122979.4218750000000000
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness	15.7217912673950195
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	155.2940673828125000
they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters	322.5415039062500000
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife	11166724.0000000000000000
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	80.1588516235351562
indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	2689697.5000000000000000
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	214.8009643554687500
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	125.0836715698242188
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	497.6087036132812500

every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	1158.2705078125000000
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	847.3428955078125000
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed	28.0606632232666016
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir	92.7648086547851562
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	7.6201663017272949
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	37.3930091857910156
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	10.4061899185180664
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	7328.3212890625000000
is this thought elizabeth meant for me	34562.4296875000000000
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	796.2358398437500000
i wish it may	526.3249511718750000

there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much	3.1641690731048584
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings	79.4709854125976562
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it	469.0812072753906250
they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration	68.3353805541992188
mr bennet made no answer	548.9153442382812500
these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like	2768.0729980468750000

i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	61.7381973266601562
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	52.1759834289550781
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered	344.7941284179687500
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	1.1974483728408813
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable	549.0866088867187500
dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky	38.9964752197265625
true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	230.9809265136718750
mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	12.6075525283813477
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention	2797.6335449218750000
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	90.1014251708984375
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	29.5605087280273438
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	14.5199565887451172
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	753.5805664062500000
she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	89.3121032714843750
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	511.9912414550781250
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn	2044.8559570312500000

whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	9.6082391738891602
oh yes pray read on	294.5095214843750000
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	138.8867187500000000
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	269.7570800781250000
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	2326.0666503906250000

the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	1759014.6250000000000000
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	16.1441307067871094
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	172278.1718750000000000
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications	119.8648147583007812
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	131781.6093750000000000
pray tell your sister that i long to see her	1030.7128906250000000
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	24.4165267944335938
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philipss manners and politeness	44.0768241882324219
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	269853.9687500000000000
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands	135.6464385986328125
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	224.6096343994140625
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	11304.9541015625000000
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	14.9159793853759766

said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest	88.9573745727539062
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	743.3088989257812500
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts	198.7099761962890625
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	163.3156127929687500
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister	1276.1375732421875000
my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him	889.1924438476562500
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	43.9173774719238281
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	10.4978485107421875
yes where else can they be so well concealed	473.0020141601562500
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	3075.4604492187500000
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity	518.9006347656250000
his brother in law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	7.5271949768066406
what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	46.0813026428222656
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	238.7444610595703125
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	6.7412304878234863

she will drop the acquaintance entirely	712.0816040039062500
i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly	3.7626721858978271
cried elizabeth when she had finished it	2469.6010742187500000
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	2152882.7500000000000000
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented	327918.5625000000000000
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	9.6244230270385742
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy	2324.2629394531250000
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do	1.6716635227203369
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas	48.7340393066406250
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	281.0177001953125000
i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	81.7239456176757812
you are then resolved to have him	95.8321456909179688
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	4.8081960678100586
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice	28.1555767059326172
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	48.4617309570312500
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	4.4207816123962402
in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	1646.3999023437500000
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	29.0938568115234375
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise	11.3921051025390625
at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter	418.7243652343750000
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	7.6488585472106934
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	99464.4843750000000000
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	67.5009689331054688
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow	2388.1596679687500000
mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	37.3254776000976562
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante	983.2500000000000000

elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do	36.1959342956542969
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	12.3016471862792969
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	395.0922546386718750
to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	155.7938842773437500
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again	26.6491508483886719
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day	452.0334472656250000
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed	983.9863891601562500
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	7078.7514648437500000
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	1583.5991210937500000
tis too much	14.6249513626098633
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	48113.3398437500000000
the period of expectation was now doubled	425.3300476074218750
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	15.0844554901123047
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	5.0871963500976562
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	240.5112915039062500
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	1330.5358886718750000
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	119.7263946533203125
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	5044.2910156250000000
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	12.2409267425537109
if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad	8.7727699279785156
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	254.3304138183593750
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well	193.9545593261718750
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	1621.9200439453125000
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	161.9010162353515625
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin	2226.7346191406250000
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	486.6456604003906250
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm	41.6173553466796875
never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her	281.6581726074218750
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	47.4653358459472656
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power	8.5179653167724609
the dejection was almost universal	230.0911865234375000
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	22.2511482238769531
certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without	1041.8521728515625000
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	489.1099853515625000
after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument	74.9447708129882812
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	8.2538328170776367
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	118.6403121948242188
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows	99.5824508666992188
mr darcy bowed	27.8372764587402344
my dear father i congratulate you	2.4834425449371338
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth	191.5171203613281250
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	1459.4260253906250000
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	194.7206268310546875
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival	196.2120208740234375
mr and mrs gardiner smiled	308.1665344238281250
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door	106.1602630615234375
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	126.8530120849609375
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	149.6721343994140625
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	2.6831946372985840
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	388.5625915527343750
nor did that day wear out her resentment	6769.6894531250000000
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	500.9842834472656250
text enclosed by underscores is in italics italics	5089.2045898437500000
well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	103.1141510009765625
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough	2446.8271484375000000
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds	114.5318832397460938
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	196.2550659179687500
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	285.1389160156250000
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg tm license when you share it without charge with others	414.3264465332031250
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance	6649.6503906250000000
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	99.7404708862304688
my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	95.9628372192382812
your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds	43.7892913818359375
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	807.3852539062500000
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied	40.2662162780761719
a lively imagination soon settled it all	2056206.0000000000000000
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better	45.6810379028320312
let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say	442.9793090820312500
and what arts did he use to separate them	84.9169158935546875
oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	141.0410461425781250
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no	20.0932807922363281
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise	118.7066345214843750
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	392.2262878417968750
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that	860.2163696289062500
mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	11.8422622680664062
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room	746.4760742187500000
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	80.5085830688476562
mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied	48982.9531250000000000
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	4639.7299804687500000
not at all	25869.8984375000000000
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good	111.6138381958007812
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	21.5247535705566406
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great	285.7561645507812500
again she read on	2506.0563964843750000
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane	234.8437652587890625
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	1812.5275878906250000
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it	97.0927124023437500
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	1305.0136718750000000
said he that is rather singular	1.0949513912200928
how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it	259.2424011230468750
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	17.1692695617675781
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family	1564.4438476562500000
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	86.4023056030273438
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge	3907.3127441406250000
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins	4.8261003494262695
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess	209.5002899169921875
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	25645.3066406250000000
may i ask to what these questions tend	21.3255538940429688
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	747.6762084960937500
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth	69.4861831665039062
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	275.3960876464843750
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you	40.4184570312500000
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house	2618732.7500000000000000
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	50.0467529296875000
a little sea bathing would set me up for ever	522237.8125000000000000
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think	6.2222189903259277
she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	20.6182804107666016
he placed himself by her	2924.4443359375000000
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover	3012.2819824218750000
you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least	5.9191269874572754
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	1203.1966552734375000
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	10823284.0000000000000000
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	5.3722152709960938
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	362.5380249023437500
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	12787.0244140625000000
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	269.5732116699218750
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	38.6859359741210938
to pemberley therefore they were to go	49.6184120178222656
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	7614.2480468750000000
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	3745.9187011718750000
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	63.5994377136230469
mrs bennets eyes sparkled	2495.8005371093750000
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	1.7532806396484375
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before	5135965.5000000000000000
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	209.5420532226562500
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only	3475102.0000000000000000
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune	1425.7592773437500000
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not	21.8752784729003906
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home	47.4947471618652344
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	13.6276569366455078
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech	64.6253204345703125
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	595.9832153320312500
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	3962.1274414062500000
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	123.6529235839843750
her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	26.9262084960937500
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	103092.3750000000000000
pride and prejudice	468.0869140625000000
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	36.4390716552734375
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself	1459.0058593750000000
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	26.0504817962646484
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn	178.1380767822265625
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	163.5812988281250000
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	230.9152832031250000
with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic	30841.9160156250000000
as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	257.6758728027343750
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many	52.0040626525878906
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy	72.6971817016601562
cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome	3.2017147541046143
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	116.1072387695312500
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	2079.7543945312500000
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	375.8734741210937500
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	24.7341670989990234
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	384.8087158203125000
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	59.7840423583984375
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	51.8355293273925781
lydia declared herself satisfied	15.7685747146606445
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	60.2307281494140625
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution	2.7917556762695312
he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete	887.7913818359375000
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	30.4494533538818359
it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	117.7960052490234375
this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	7.5248622894287109
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	493.7211914062500000
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her	37.6791458129882812
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might	1953.4876708984375000
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	61.5326461791992188
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	9.0283088684082031
how strange must it appear to him	17.1953868865966797
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	518.2238769531250000
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month	1277.2711181640625000
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	65.9121017456054688
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works reports performances and research	107.9796142578125000
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	308.9171752929687500
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	334.1950378417968750
but georgiana would not join her	119.4606094360351562
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	14.6672887802124023
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him	12.1685390472412109
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	27.4993209838867188
elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal	221812.6562500000000000
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	5.0026712417602539
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening	9.0730228424072266
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him	35.0361518859863281
in three volumes	707.7003784179687500
how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia	122.1893157958984375
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him	37.4643898010253906
i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech	14.1235094070434570
he readily agreed to it	4.5812635421752930
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it	330.8956604003906250
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way	1.1372762918472290
i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	130.0867767333984375
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	1347.0333251953125000
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	34.6113319396972656
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	106.2607879638671875
oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	25.3772430419921875
this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced	194.2241516113281250
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	801.3225097656250000
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power	274.3264465332031250
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	29.7826175689697266
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	5.8676819801330566
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	3857.4697265625000000
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	13.2735900878906250
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	10433.2714843750000000
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter	27.6713981628417969
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	25.2153091430664062
i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience	343.9266357421875000
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	92.6098556518554688
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	2251.4265136718750000
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year	3.0767934322357178
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	245.8507080078125000
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	5601.2016601562500000
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	40.9949645996093750
lady catherine seemed pleased	62.4554710388183594
there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother	805.1768188476562500
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last	95111.1015625000000000
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	122.5790252685546875
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	1551.6660156250000000
mr darcy is not to be laughed at	3.6328687667846680
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly	2146.3132324218750000
a carat character is used to denote superscription	2408.0703125000000000

and mary king is safe	28.1151962280273438
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	1221.3764648437500000
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	219.8837280273437500
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	661.9314575195312500
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father	35.8824882507324219
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	268.7543334960937500
i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford	64.8250579833984375
you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house	1756.8039550781250000
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her	1904.4764404296875000
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring	75.9756088256835938

your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss bennet	5.8909759521484375
she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	45.2779273986816406
the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	384.2553405761718750
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	1.3482007980346680
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg tm works	6.9686031341552734

colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out	2096.9289550781250000
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	5.2056155204772949
aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all	1663.3155517578125000
