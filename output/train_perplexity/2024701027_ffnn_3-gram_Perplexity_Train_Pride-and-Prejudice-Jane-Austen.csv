mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire	125.1911849975585938
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	66.2950439453125000
i am glad you are come back lizzy	73.6431045532226562
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	44.4582366943359375
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	8.5820274353027344
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	25.3320274353027344
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	20.9563560485839844
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	55.8099212646484375
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	69.4845962524414062
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	122.7726974487304688
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	242.8954162597656250
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	84.6576766967773438
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	3.4949376583099365
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	32.0773086547851562
elizabeth immediately began playing again	93.0741577148437500
just as you please	67.0055084228515625
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	286.0497131347656250
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	22.6538372039794922
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	6.6731829643249512
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	69.6458435058593750
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	188.2813568115234375
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	11.1226673126220703
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	19.6269741058349609
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	84.4537429809570312
and what did she say	42.0354728698730469
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	40.9625167846679688
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs	58.8915672302246094
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	44.0242729187011719
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	654.0310668945312500
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	168.3588409423828125
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	4.4471726417541504
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	19.5835971832275391
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	1446.5594482421875000
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	116.5236053466796875
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	140.6846466064453125
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	32.8841629028320312
indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night	3.1581850051879883
everything wore a happier aspect	402.4116516113281250
bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	17.8208847045898438
that is not very likely our authority was too good	48.0343017578125000
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	370.4053344726562500
sir william had been delighted with him	1147.3245849609375000
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	6.6256461143493652
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	23.5513896942138672
one of them does	23.1908168792724609
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	3.5225267410278320

oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson	67.1650695800781250
if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	61.4204292297363281
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation	76.6091156005859375
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	70.2115936279296875
what can be the meaning of this	5.5825767517089844
wickham lydia were all forgotten	265.7870788574218750
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	15.3570842742919922
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	36.6341896057128906
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	48.0542755126953125
yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases	322.0029907226562500
true are the others coming out	42.0050125122070312
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	138.3730163574218750
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	31.5458927154541016
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	1.7233393192291260
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	100.3744430541992188

he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	134.3924713134765625
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	26.7338657379150391
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	41.3477897644042969
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	6.8753027915954590
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	16.4620742797851562
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	7.3881635665893555
what would she have said how would she have behaved	1848.3613281250000000
but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	5.7463130950927734
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	11.7287721633911133
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	12.3633756637573242
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	1.5651273727416992
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	19.5215778350830078
london printed for t egerton military library whitehall	30.3532848358154297
the tête à tête surprised them	152.7469940185546875
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	63.4983139038085938
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	5.5740146636962891
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	465.9082031250000000
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	17.5656394958496094
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	72.0879516601562500
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	688.6628417968750000
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	5.0125479698181152
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	27.5496139526367188
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	908.9561767578125000
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	1916.0928955078125000
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	293.7084655761718750
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	69.0294876098632812
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	6.0249733924865723
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	9.8114185333251953
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	16.7448883056640625
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy	27.0732192993164062
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	6.8103895187377930
not yet replied jane	6.6271538734436035
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better	293.0545959472656250
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said	6.2654132843017578
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	232.3596954345703125
it was as follows	9.0059633255004883
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him	23.9471759796142578
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	129.5552062988281250
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	22.7172451019287109
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	94.5030059814453125
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	151.1948547363281250
see <file name> or <file name> <url> or <url>	8.7459888458251953
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	102.1752929687500000
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	11.0692577362060547
from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	180.7331085205078125
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	428.0913696289062500
indeed i have sir was her answer	14.9911413192749023
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	13.8247280120849609
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	13.4785690307617188
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	116.7492904663085938
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	25.8053092956542969
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	22.1319561004638672
and do you impute it to either of those	5.8536028861999512
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	16.6371021270751953
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	15.0637855529785156
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	66.6474075317382812
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	151.1107482910156250
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	11.3104705810546875
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	94.7861557006835938
i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true	3.1681349277496338
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	155.1448516845703125
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	40.2828636169433594
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been	311.6138000488281250
yes or i will never see her again	35.0658721923828125
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	128.4654998779296875
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	3.8348050117492676
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	13.0669631958007812
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	3841.6945800781250000
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	19.7989444732666016
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	180.6388702392578125
mrs hurst thought the same and added	2.7791187763214111
yet why did he come	39.7314567565917969
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	8.1850137710571289
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	107.6858062744140625
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	217.6017608642578125
were questions with which she amused herself	5.3337192535400391
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend	45.2891769409179688
mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all	100.3756942749023438
at length the parsonage was discernible	22.8470058441162109
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	48.0183219909667969
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point	418.1714477539062500
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	210.4079132080078125
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest	36.8978729248046875
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	64.2594909667968750
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	2128.4055175781250000
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	572.9413452148437500
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	42.0781517028808594
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	149.5694122314453125
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	581.5527954101562500
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	53.5447311401367188
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	53.3273658752441406
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	31.6570262908935547
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	4.1432967185974121
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	258.2988586425781250
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	8.3870306015014648
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	1067.4660644531250000
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	406.8145751953125000
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	111.6804809570312500
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	356.5906066894531250
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	46.2316818237304688
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	39.5570487976074219
my uncle is to send a servant for us	56.1632995605468750
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	44.2026481628417969
in three volumes	485.1776123046875000
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	30.6079177856445312
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	24.1918220520019531
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	86.4303741455078125
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	10.5814580917358398
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	269.7953796386718750
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm	156.2036895751953125
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying	87.6827621459960938
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	4.3942885398864746
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	612.2145996093750000
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	425.1513977050781250
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	67.6186218261718750
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	1828.5648193359375000
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	156.8937225341796875
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	101.6573410034179688
her father lifted up his eyes	22.6394424438476562
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	71.0562744140625000
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	26.3554058074951172
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	1422.6210937500000000
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	7.0566930770874023
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	35.8176193237304688
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	505.6705322265625000
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	178.3752441406250000
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game	15.6187143325805664
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	764.6499023437500000
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	8.7036685943603516
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	5.9682083129882812
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	7.8565163612365723
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said	196.1797485351562500
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	36.1955718994140625
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	6.5432043075561523
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	3.9985809326171875
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	5.1581659317016602
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	46.1722106933593750
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth	415.2512817382812500
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	34.7420997619628906
cried mrs gardiner	26.9027919769287109
there was also a postscript to this effect	1.6327815055847168
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made	74.4603652954101562
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	11.2685232162475586
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	4.9365725517272949
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties	54.6296348571777344
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	18.8639736175537109
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	19.9255905151367188
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	17.1833248138427734
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet	1688.1843261718750000
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	91.5224609375000000
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	243.8231811523437500
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	25.7641048431396484
occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	52.4385948181152344
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	282.8115234375000000
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	93.7821884155273438
do you really think so	273.6141967773437500
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	5.2238373756408691
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	18.8785343170166016
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	64.7634277343750000
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	9.9809455871582031
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	501.4878540039062500
you are severe on us	33.7245483398437500
good god what is the matter	26.7925052642822266
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	8.8957452774047852
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	247.1622772216796875
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	60.4019699096679688
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	10.0208768844604492
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	2.4774422645568848
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	11.0004911422729492
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying	26.5654640197753906
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	36.3140373229980469
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	137.0767364501953125
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	14.7940073013305664
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	185.5076904296875000
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	242.4850463867187500
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast	471.9682922363281250
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	7.2037596702575684
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last	18.2043190002441406
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	31.2479896545410156
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	10.9892845153808594
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	109.2425460815429688
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	45.9585189819335938
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable	30.9531211853027344
author jane austen	37.7288932800292969
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak	92.3434295654296875
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	1.4970240592956543
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	9.7828655242919922
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love	67.0365753173828125
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	12.5716962814331055
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	9.6670570373535156
she certainly did not hate him	22.2559394836425781
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty	2139.1835937500000000
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	121.1748504638671875
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	2.9004659652709961
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added	7.3039040565490723
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	499.2220153808593750
release date <date> ebook <hashtag>	611.9711303710937500
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	104.5542297363281250
are you not diverted	95.0023040771484375
elizabeth was in agonies	84.9672927856445312
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	81.9521560668945312
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	25.4715824127197266
yes very well i saw them the night before last	58.9416275024414062
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	43.3810462951660156
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	2.3321735858917236
her own thoughts were employing her	4.1977815628051758
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	37.0141372680664062
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued	2.6190888881683350
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls	15.7011680603027344
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	419.9632873535156250
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation	228.2914581298828125
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	71.0103683471679688
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	46.6539726257324219
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	81.1466751098632812
and my mother how is she how are you all	135.2055969238281250
all was joy and kindness	28.0407657623291016
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	22.9193115234375000
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	135.9496154785156250
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	54.1219100952148438
mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	41.8378562927246094
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	34.4819412231445312
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	150.2518615722656250
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	34.0746612548828125
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	83.3478012084960938
it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	55.9755096435546875
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	87.1650924682617188
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	62.0618438720703125
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	89.2127532958984375
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	131.2617492675781250
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	4.8219428062438965
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	169.4878082275390625
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	30.0351181030273438
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	486.7419433593750000
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled	83.4609909057617188
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe	32.1344680786132812
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	56.9348335266113281
but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it	33.1419258117675781
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	273.3837890625000000
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	1.3301930427551270
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	122.0676574707031250
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	22.6759281158447266
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	622.3268432617187500
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	85.3391494750976562
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	127.8473205566406250
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	721.5573730468750000
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	5.8081059455871582
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home	28.5364494323730469
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	32.3180580139160156
but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	77.9641265869140625
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home	4.7495608329772949
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	49.8263435363769531
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	40.5967559814453125
they found mr bennet still up	62.6671562194824219
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him	49.0591011047363281
it was a rational scheme to be sure	50.4660873413085938
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any	9.4657316207885742
could i expect it to be otherwise	164.9303283691406250
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply	1947.5278320312500000
it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up	183.5520324707031250
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage	10.3540487289428711
oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	132.5104675292968750
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	88.0151596069335938
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	4.0669527053833008
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	20.5050201416015625
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	76.9961700439453125
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	10.7317066192626953
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls	32.1203422546386719
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	205.3756103515625000
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	17.0493984222412109
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	11.7124013900756836
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	296.6085815429687500
how much of good or evil must be done by him	1.2607171535491943
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	6.3962459564208984
and so was i	107.9795608520507812
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	5.7782459259033203
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	59.0591430664062500
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	1.7303214073181152
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	43.4644660949707031
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	8.4896488189697266

colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	14.4262189865112305
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	28.0762805938720703
and have you heard from him often	31.0571670532226562
a great deal more passed at the other table	142.9905395507812500
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	17.6887931823730469
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	70.8591156005859375
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	171.8607635498046875
they had several children	77.1895675659179688
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it	18.4427967071533203
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best	162.8234710693359375
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	57.3748626708984375
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	35.0848274230957031
said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	17.9041862487792969
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	38.6263236999511719
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	6.2836613655090332
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	8.1580953598022461
and men take care that they should	266.5685424804687500
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	116.6431274414062500
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	62.5386428833007812
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	1.4474360942840576
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy	730.9771728515625000
her colour changed and she said no more	105.1457901000976562
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	255.1778411865234375
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	7.2455558776855469
elizabeth you are not serious now	30.0839614868164062
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	37.2399139404296875
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	4.3145546913146973
there was no want of discourse	416.6222229003906250
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	111.7132415771484375
he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	40.3082199096679688
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	70.3693618774414062
is it possible	36.1886520385742188
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	58.9235649108886719
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	8.0000438690185547
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	39.5191612243652344
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	1.5530515909194946
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	24.6890277862548828
the first week of their return was soon gone	2.6703701019287109
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment	7.2681279182434082
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	5.7691516876220703
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	6.5405559539794922
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below	10.3023834228515625
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can	96.2257614135742188
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	194.2422943115234375
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	22.9848270416259766
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	127.8626861572265625
well and what news does it bring good or bad	225.1134338378906250
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	29.0765552520751953
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	24.5225753784179688
she was ashamed to think how much	528.7186279296875000
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	90.7487487792968750
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her	103.9648666381835938
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	16.3963241577148438
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	12.1897001266479492
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	21.0018730163574219

it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing	7.4443778991699219
of what are you talking	452.1235961914062500
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying	16.3253669738769531
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	2.8191771507263184
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	1364.0416259765625000
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	195.3833160400390625
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	518.7185668945312500
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	3.5195124149322510
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	31.7292728424072266
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	59.0096282958984375
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	12.6704368591308594
i must ask whether you were surprised	17.1133537292480469
but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	168.4328765869140625
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity	28.4462471008300781
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	196.3514709472656250
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	68.1464538574218750
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	35.2574348449707031
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	38.7958488464355469
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	27.6273097991943359
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	7.3047256469726562
no no stay where you are you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye	104.3650512695312500
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	28.1966228485107422
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	51.9054946899414062
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	152.5650787353515625
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	194.2773284912109375
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	59.3309326171875000
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	4.7674717903137207
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	217.3411560058593750
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	31.1484985351562500
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all	161.3445892333984375
we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	322.0676879882812500
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	4577.2080078125000000
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party	26.8195266723632812
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	179.5044250488281250
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him	2222.3930664062500000
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	34.8007774353027344
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	440.5664672851562500
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	204.0949554443359375
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	116.2531051635742188
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	55.4038429260253906
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	15.5646791458129883
u s laws alone swamp our small staff	216.7522583007812500
how acutely did she now feel it	31.7494449615478516
he seldom appeared really animated	504.2997131347656250
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num> f<num> this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	15.8029432296752930
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark	86.2080612182617188
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	21.3019943237304688
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	21.8841743469238281
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed	118.7978057861328125
tis an etiquette i despise said he	8.2240972518920898
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	13.8401165008544922
jane was distressed	73.7301101684570312
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we	4.6401839256286621
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance	217.2018280029296875
thank you but i always mend my own	1640.8416748046875000
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	40.8281211853027344
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to	94.2730178833007812
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	213.4655303955078125
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	625.9401855468750000
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	5.3884882926940918
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	8.3591184616088867
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	22.9945259094238281
in understanding darcy was the superior	89.2517318725585938
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted	251.4421997070312500
their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse	51.8694610595703125
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	172.3170166015625000
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	5.8942890167236328
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	48.0823974609375000
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living	105.3296051025390625
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	11.1905994415283203
why did she come	7.5535359382629395
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	2.1633069515228271
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	183.1365661621093750
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	28.5841407775878906
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	4.5969638824462891
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	4.0818133354187012
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	140.4872894287109375
oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him	4.1992521286010742
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	352.2626342773437500
can i have the carriage	20.8816261291503906
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	3.3878068923950195
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out	183.3397216796875000
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawing room	13.1566286087036133
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	230.4331970214843750
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	4.2265334129333496
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	47.9160499572753906
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here	921.3895874023437500
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	15.8343372344970703
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	17.3594436645507812
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	27.3650474548339844
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	291.7481689453125000
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	20.2599067687988281
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	55.1887626647949219
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite disconcerted	121.4583587646484375
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	192.0907440185546875
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	26.9463863372802734
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	35.5299186706542969
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	61.9088897705078125
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession	3.0290563106536865
royalty payments must be paid within <num> days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	454.8197631835937500
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable	303.3537292480468750
and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song	30.0920982360839844
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	3.3819301128387451
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	27.3804359436035156
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	68.6801834106445312
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	49.8093910217285156
his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	4.0770163536071777
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	614.0283813476562500
perhaps we might be deceived	728.9298095703125000
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	90.1399383544921875
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	16.6092300415039062
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming	10.3882579803466797
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	64.9267501831054688
good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	11.7960357666015625
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	243.0560150146484375
added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	20.4937343597412109
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	25.4704227447509766
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	3.2780101299285889
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	13.2347278594970703
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	46.2971572875976562
what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is	8.6291589736938477
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing	54.0245208740234375
take whatever you like and get away	237.1965637207031250
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	6.3356208801269531
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill health	13.8326435089111328
his character was decided	22.5618324279785156
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	504.8200988769531250
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	2.8966991901397705
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	47.8928718566894531
as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	206.2728424072265625
money my uncle	11.3315858840942383
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	369.3015136718750000
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it	80.0348739624023438
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch	36.7147216796875000
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	12.7956266403198242
for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	56.1555671691894531
in the hall they parted	1140.0255126953125000
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	7.0350604057312012
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	693.5686035156250000
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added	19.6733551025390625
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	16.5603084564208984
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	21.6362152099609375
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	101.7329788208007812
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	10.8995809555053711
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	13.0558929443359375
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	189.5104064941406250
catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	157.5743560791015625
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	2580.6689453125000000
my dear harriet	1047.8245849609375000
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	32.9652061462402344
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	7.1765422821044922
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	331.8995971679687500
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	15.1602993011474609
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	628.0835571289062500
no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	18.3919010162353516
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	47.1031646728515625
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	28.8342590332031250
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	3.8002767562866211
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	1117.4627685546875000
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	20.6376152038574219
yet it did and even a third	158.4067382812500000
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	231.7673339843750000
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	18.2908229827880859
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	4.0164327621459961
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	89.5615768432617188
nearly three weeks	33.8106155395507812
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	3.3447370529174805
how can you contrive to write so even	84.1003799438476562
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud	2.2549967765808105
the following sentence with active links to or other immediate access to the full project gutenberg tm license must appear prominently whenever any copy of a project gutenberg tm work any work on which the phrase project gutenberg appears or with which the phrase project gutenberg is associated is accessed displayed performed viewed copied or distributed	11.5488548278808594
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	126.3997955322265625
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room	12.5335464477539062
mr wickham began the subject himself	11.1423940658569336
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	244.8429565429687500
oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	215.7420501708984375
i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir	10.5491466522216797
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	12.6913356781005859
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	31.3428173065185547
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	37.1543388366699219
and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean	1.5674103498458862
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	6.8289837837219238
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	42.6552734375000000
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	132.6613616943359375
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	222.8716735839843750
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	12.2766284942626953
lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	25.7311210632324219
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	522.1901855468750000
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	2.9268708229064941
this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	13.2633399963378906
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	72.7184295654296875
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	68.9460372924804688
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth	201.8759613037109375
haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	18.0885639190673828
the girls stared at their father	10.1855239868164062
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead	38.4288253784179688
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	43.2008972167968750
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	21.4239578247070312
you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	27.9035835266113281
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is	10.3869018554687500
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	17.9624156951904297
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	63.3735084533691406
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	12.0146884918212891
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	268.4620361328125000
she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness	5.2673954963684082
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	25.5100593566894531
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	62.4195594787597656
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	72.0518341064453125
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	26.5457878112792969
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	59.2047767639160156
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	114.7188720703125000
their table was superlatively stupid	13.4289751052856445
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	40.7645835876464844
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	8.0821447372436523
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	21.4609699249267578
i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	29.7786197662353516
what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	359.9324035644531250
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	17.7955722808837891
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	86.9706268310546875
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	212.8579864501953125
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	92.3078536987304688
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	3.4032750129699707
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	329.4387512207031250
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state	20.7670001983642578
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	143.9538726806640625
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	34.4655342102050781
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st	61.5879745483398438
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	25.2345790863037109
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	10.5641145706176758
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	4.2103290557861328
nothing that she could say however had any influence	2450.1933593750000000
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	11.2590513229370117
blame you oh no	25.6497783660888672
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	325.2723388671875000
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	158.6051330566406250
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	17.3528232574462891
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	75.9809417724609375
with the officers	9.9229621887207031
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	73.1371536254882812
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	21.2961997985839844
has your governess left you	2762.7890625000000000
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	1355.6756591796875000
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	9.4542236328125000
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	1492.3364257812500000
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	4.3942885398864746
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	133.9617614746093750
there was no arguing upon such a project	105.2677917480468750
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	221.6509857177734375
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	17.1457958221435547
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	1262.5058593750000000
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them	32.4528656005859375
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	45.1003875732421875
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	4.8559222221374512
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added	58.0019836425781250
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	4.8005323410034180
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	273.2120056152343750
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	7.2138037681579590
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	527.0939331054687500
miss elizabeth bennet	230.8851318359375000
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	258.2658386230468750
we never had any governess	14.2611713409423828
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	755.8145751953125000
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	44.8184928894042969
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	331.2294006347656250
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	78.1269073486328125
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	162.8133850097656250
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been	337.1310729980468750
miss bennet still looked all amazement	7.7063827514648438
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	668.4849853515625000
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	2.0975961685180664
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	165.0592041015625000
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton	34.4738464355468750
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	15.9318008422851562
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	314.0914916992187500
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	8.2351160049438477
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	5.2545857429504395
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	42.2829360961914062
but still he would be her husband	27.8704929351806641
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	7.3828716278076172
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in	104.4882354736328125
you pay a royalty fee of <num> of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes	2.4785923957824707
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	2.2932860851287842
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	500.8003234863281250
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	16.3969955444335938
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	136.4777374267578125
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	133.1238861083984375
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	437.6873474121093750
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person	2.6462335586547852
how despicably have i acted	98.0172500610351562
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	53.0153846740722656
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there	18.0657463073730469
no not at all	7.4937357902526855
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	87.1295623779296875
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	1676.1589355468750000
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	28.1029834747314453
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	27.5040225982666016
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected	68.6397171020507812
this will not do said elizabeth	17.3226070404052734
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours c	5.6846389770507812
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	16.6696395874023438
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	26.1230258941650391
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	223.0558319091796875
it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	136.7834320068359375
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	11.0031642913818359
see paragraph <num> c below	123.0639343261718750
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	70.7180862426757812
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	20.1468944549560547
they had long wished to see him	164.8244934082031250
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	270.0869445800781250
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	64.8196258544921875
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	2297.7355957031250000
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	20.2510223388671875
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	103.6551437377929688
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	1.6249802112579346
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	2.5424420833587646
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	102.5278091430664062
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	360.0244140625000000
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	27.9627571105957031
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	1.7323632240295410
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them	212.2900543212890625
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill	34.0018997192382812
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	15.4181680679321289
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	32.0901451110839844
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	10.9494485855102539

indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	33.5429954528808594
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	31.4093151092529297
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	1022.9439086914062500
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	11.8345708847045898
if your master would marry you might see more of him	177.8938751220703125
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	41.6004829406738281
nothing could console and nothing appease her	24.3013458251953125
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	364.3024902343750000
cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened	44.5181732177734375
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	196.3415527343750000
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	10.3372507095336914
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	180.4092102050781250
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	627.1710205078125000
mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	116.8914489746093750
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	278.5000915527343750
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation	9.8015899658203125
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	32.7821884155273438
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you	210.7112274169921875
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	168.4732055664062500
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	62.0618438720703125
yours sincerely c	98.0111312866210938
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield	36.6220512390136719
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	535.1070556640625000
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	3306.8400878906250000
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	79.7337188720703125
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other	14.8086061477661133
mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	6.6271524429321289
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	11.8575372695922852
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	24.2467937469482422
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	38.3399963378906250
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	15.5494899749755859
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	82.8193435668945312
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	178.7914733886718750
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	18.8038825988769531
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	39.0591316223144531
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	7.8992714881896973
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	27.0827751159667969
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	38.5247116088867188
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	4.0243086814880371
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	82.9818191528320312
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family	280.0028991699218750
upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know	94.3022308349609375
you are uniformly charming	40.6295051574707031
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	2.7531354427337646
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion	101.2617416381835938
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	1044.8759765625000000
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	1.5323866605758667
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	6.0433030128479004
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	396.4784545898437500
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	12.3766288757324219
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel	263.4144287109375000
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	167.8446502685546875
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	292.9584655761718750
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	543.7554321289062500
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	19.7935447692871094
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	9.5672750473022461
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	13.2240924835205078
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	24.0519104003906250
not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	31.1809673309326172
though her manner varied however her determination never did	155.6698760986328125
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	101.0154418945312500
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	204.5724792480468750
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence	9.0460042953491211
elizabeth on her side had much to do	556.6549682617187500
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	61.6679115295410156
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	1.8930013179779053
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	91.8451385498046875
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	554.6611938476562500
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	111.1829910278320312
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	10.6574239730834961
mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	27.7432441711425781
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	19.0789432525634766
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	6558.4985351562500000
here she was interrupted again	4.0243282318115234
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	32.7894325256347656
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	171.8809356689453125
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works	6.4015192985534668
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	32.7625808715820312
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	39.3735504150390625
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	8.5820274353027344
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	262.5090026855468750
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her	16.9627647399902344
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	7.7043237686157227
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	95.1997528076171875
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	222.8318176269531250
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry	26.4584331512451172
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am	110.7259674072265625
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	24.7413806915283203
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	5.3340520858764648
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	7.3325023651123047
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	285.9620056152343750
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	179.1481170654296875
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	377.1283874511718750
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	26.5367450714111328
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections	14.2480630874633789
others of the party were now applied to	63.8519783020019531
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	5.4696912765502930
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	639.3744506835937500
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	73.6152267456054688
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	343.7938537597656250
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	10.0965013504028320
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	60.3829078674316406
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	48.3698501586914062
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	24.9517021179199219
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	61.2763900756835938
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	23.4989776611328125
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	5.8406581878662109
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	33.9293479919433594
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	15.8563470840454102
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	49.0034027099609375
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed	14.2361173629760742
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	243.6096801757812500
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	7.2270436286926270
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	13.2786731719970703
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score	388.0252990722656250
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	112.6164245605468750
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	493.0639038085937500
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	6.9313721656799316
his words seemed to imply it	50.2002906799316406
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	56.3794898986816406
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	11.2508974075317383
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	5194.4965820312500000
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	14.0983734130859375
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	7745.5078125000000000
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	12.3790788650512695
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	837.1505126953125000
my dear niece	21.5761852264404297
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num> e<num>	637.3678588867187500
elizabeth coloured and said a little	1776.6278076171875000
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said	327.8132934570312500
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	65.8966751098632812
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	9.4524898529052734
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	15.3322658538818359
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	7.2790112495422363
it was to this effect	100.7493362426757812
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	183.5654296875000000
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him	61.5260772705078125
i hope not	4.3857326507568359
but i was embarrassed	38.4474639892578125
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	23.7467613220214844
said jane as she finished it	22.5277843475341797
well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	118.9304885864257812
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said	46.5411567687988281
he drew a chair near her	4.6820549964904785
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	53.8978271484375000
on both sides it was only assertion	5.3181576728820801
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels	352.6850280761718750
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	3.6171605587005615
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	37.9557571411132812
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	86.4630203247070312
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	36.1023979187011719
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her	14.8877191543579102
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	34.3541946411132812
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	86.0062942504882812
said her aunt	383.5386657714843750
mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding	19.9344863891601562
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	25.9597988128662109
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	1.4973677396774292
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	26.7729797363281250
he was silent	28.6361827850341797
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	96.7404785156250000
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	60.4287681579589844
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	88.7195587158203125
but how did he account for it	598.2710571289062500
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	4.0771565437316895
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	9.4633951187133789
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	92.5775833129882812
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	19.3276519775390625
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	43.9273338317871094
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy	2.7547605037689209
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	26.6200923919677734
very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so	230.6738281250000000
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	4.1099877357482910
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	12.0357580184936523
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	5148.5664062500000000

miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	20.1840915679931641
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	10.6842908859252930
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	5.6672692298889160
he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	115.2601165771484375
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	18.8803386688232422
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	14.7316837310791016
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	399.4933471679687500
for the liveliness of your mind i did	108.5910644531250000
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	17.6471862792968750
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	822.8911132812500000
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	113.8507156372070312
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions	6.2099118232727051
what none of you	4.6523613929748535
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	48.4737014770507812

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	4.7452006340026855
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	139.7879180908203125
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	21.1216430664062500
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	236.5836791992187500
mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read	2.6915450096130371
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	1194.6236572265625000
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	88.1480407714843750
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	73.1654815673828125
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	916.4181518554687500
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	12.0755968093872070
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	179.9485168457031250
oh yes i understand you perfectly	75.9426956176757812
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	43.3661651611328125
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	766.0560913085937500
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	71.0333328247070312
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued	289.6865234375000000
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time	1457.8480224609375000
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	12777.5166015625000000
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	41.9556465148925781
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	27.1144790649414062

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	75.7439956665039062
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	117.2242965698242188
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something	230.8254547119140625
elizabeths courage did not fail her	575.8594360351562500
do not you want to know who has taken it	2025.2928466796875000
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	128.5985107421875000
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west	15.3170957565307617
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	265.4241943359375000
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	253.4061737060546875
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	33.1101150512695312
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest	17.8768653869628906
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	10.4464378356933594

she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	6.0243506431579590
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	4.2725367546081543
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	174.2574615478515625
he must be an oddity i think said she	16.2496547698974609
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	15.7917423248291016
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said	40.1955146789550781
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	74.1198654174804688
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell	22.6425209045410156
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday	649.7689208984375000
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	73.4867248535156250
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	11.6913290023803711
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	15.9932117462158203
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	3.2547132968902588
what is his name	188.0366973876953125
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	42.4042282104492188
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	109.8020324707031250
that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	848.5587768554687500
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	1.8540669679641724
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	2757.7573242187500000
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood	52.1719665527343750
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress	12.2172985076904297
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued	33.0142784118652344
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	6.1924381256103516
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind	174.1242370605468750
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	6.0287637710571289
you write uncommonly fast	61.5879745483398438
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	56.5642433166503906
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	6.4520082473754883
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	102.9707717895507812
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	45.7850646972656250
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	10.7307062149047852
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy	12.0888843536376953
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	13.7196874618530273
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	35.6896705627441406
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	340.7006225585937500
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	20.1963806152343750
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	10.1513423919677734
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	60.0690765380859375
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	56.9597816467285156
let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	241.0299987792968750
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	51.9193382263183594
she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	15.3700084686279297
his plan did not vary on seeing them	963.5782470703125000
this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever	486.2147216796875000
then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married	116.3195343017578125
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	328.5716857910156250
cried his wife impatiently	71.5069427490234375
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	20.0172138214111328
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him	7.2624940872192383
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	359.0163879394531250
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	33.5355072021484375
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	126.6725234985351562
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	6.5172772407531738
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce	174.6494293212890625
they had frequently been staying with her in town	29.6872653961181641
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	124.2978286743164062
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	366.5495605468750000
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	3.4209108352661133
no nothing at all	13.5598878860473633
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	11.9789018630981445
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	40.8489570617675781
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	13.0944261550903320
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	76.1299133300781250
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	10.2530984878540039
jane was not happy	22.3482627868652344
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise	1.6904699802398682
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	70.4761505126953125
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	810.9356689453125000
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	2.3447797298431396
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town	60.6752052307128906
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	19.1610736846923828
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	5.1900300979614258
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	49.5086517333984375
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	121.9210128784179688
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	1455.4737548828125000
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	402.8488464355468750
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	303.3408508300781250
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	26.9241027832031250
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	123.9581985473632812
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	54.0404853820800781
see paragraph <num> e below	569.4181518554687500
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	76.5147399902343750
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	5.4862976074218750
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	767.3092651367187500
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	11.8364658355712891
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	1.9833225011825562
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	45.3588256835937500
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	5.9599127769470215
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it	4.2831616401672363
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	155.7973785400390625
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	599.5996093750000000
and quite alone have all her friends left her	207.0319976806640625
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	152.1214447021484375
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said	43.6025581359863281
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	66.0989913940429688
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	13.1459245681762695
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	9.4806852340698242
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	5.7575564384460449
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	4.0145902633666992
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	7.0801806449890137
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	27.2652645111083984
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	228.8956298828125000
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	41.1315650939941406
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	31.4373035430908203
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	47.4768104553222656
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	11.1971549987792969
what is there of good to be expected	6.8001303672790527
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	2.8379116058349609
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	425.8839111328125000
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	26.3299140930175781
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	62.2728462219238281
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	63.6879882812500000
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	29.5533084869384766
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied	23.7151279449462891
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied	1.2770705223083496
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	445.7771606445312500
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	16.2435493469238281
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles	143.2123870849609375
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing	31.6271209716796875
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows	64.7972793579101562
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	13.5445528030395508
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	43.3808364868164062
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	41.7450294494628906
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	14.4482946395874023
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well	82.8641815185546875
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business	24.3090648651123047
a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	45.4207115173339844
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	6.6395392417907715
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	136.7296447753906250
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	28.7354717254638672
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	7.4844756126403809
as they went down stairs together charlotte said	11.6457376480102539
mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	11.8240308761596680
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them	85.0177612304687500
he was on one side of her mother	510.6962890625000000
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	906.4172363281250000
her ease and good spirits increased	54.2565460205078125
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	245.3208312988281250
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	68.5889358520507812
which do you mean	11.9232330322265625
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	27.0003890991210938
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	27.2347087860107422
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	516.9822998046875000
her answer was warmly in his favour	206.7862243652343750
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	335.6561584472656250
in that case he would return no more	149.5637817382812500
did charlotte dine with you	76.1148910522460938
by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	96.7984390258789062
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small	191.7707061767578125
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	1385.6101074218750000
a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment	28.8476448059082031
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	28.3486595153808594
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	131.6166839599609375
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	135.7831268310546875
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	2.9293701648712158
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	3.7338955402374268
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	33.7705612182617188
elizabeth almost stared at her	814.8894653320312500
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	1494.8826904296875000
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	201.0944824218750000
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	26.9211902618408203
oh mr collins	210.8706512451171875
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	18.6038932800292969
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	11.7108154296875000
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	7.2131462097167969
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	113.1415405273437500
mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense	68.3401718139648438
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration	2.3184640407562256
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	146.6189117431640625
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	81.8675613403320312
and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins	109.7642288208007812
gracechurch street monday	110.2971420288085938
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	410.7182922363281250
she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet	42.9408111572265625
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	165.0334625244140625
and pray may i ask	222.6379852294921875
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	91.6292190551757812
elizabeth looked surprised	59.5947418212890625
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	20.9290351867675781
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	42.8921356201171875
on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must	81.6047439575195312
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces	40.7320404052734375
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance	23.3970336914062500
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	1.3800611495971680

on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	17.4655647277832031

to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	8.0682659149169922
it was over at last however	85.9973144531250000
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	10.4385528564453125
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	121.3766784667968750

i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	186.7474670410156250
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	25.9355049133300781

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	37.1633453369140625
my dear friend	703.6483154296875000

but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	2.6085216999053955

when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	125.2395553588867188
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	71.5802154541015625
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this	41.0941848754882812
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	513.0805053710937500
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	25.3337135314941406

when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	19.3111171722412109

on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	203.4534759521484375
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you	114.9141693115234375
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	100.1119308471679688
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name	8.1461124420166016
elizabeth made no answer	97.2536849975585938
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	61.0228614807128906
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	128.8073425292968750
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	132.3963928222656250
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	7.4123220443725586
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	240.3768157958984375
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	2317.8071289062500000
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table	156.5895385742187500
he made no answer	296.9729919433593750
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	171.7677001953125000
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	6.5618238449096680
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	126.8464202880859375
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	72.8659133911132812
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	1725.0190429687500000
it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	138.2216796875000000
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	20.5408420562744141
the envelope itself was likewise full	41.6949310302734375
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	5.4919805526733398
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	5.7002682685852051
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	2562.9570312500000000
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	111.2450866699218750
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	60.2099380493164062
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature	3.9135854244232178
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	231.0117797851562500
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	259.1939697265625000
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	40.5757102966308594
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	138.2705841064453125
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins	136.9027099609375000
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	65.1196670532226562
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	3.2641718387603760
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	3.8681204319000244
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	139.6675872802734375
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	7.2331304550170898
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy	443.2675170898437500
elizabeth was forced to go	3.1275081634521484
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	116.0221176147460938
the supposition did not pain her	7.9898986816406250
she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy	39.8892555236816406
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks	17.5707759857177734
invented by m rs bell <num> charlotte street bedford square	12.9241027832031250
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it	81.2538070678710938
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	3.3355879783630371
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility	68.3933792114257812
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane	5.7615699768066406
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	8.4872941970825195
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	50.1333007812500000
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	289.6728515625000000
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment	8.6464319229125977
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy	13.8437232971191406
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	520.7700805664062500
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	440.5769958496093750
what should not you mind	338.2447204589843750
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence	154.4803161621093750
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	2.4620070457458496
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	65.9382019042968750
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	5.4838624000549316
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	143.7816772460937500
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	10.9947996139526367
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him	160.3562316894531250
she could think only of her letter	90.5458145141601562
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	14.6761035919189453
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	13.8614788055419922
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	31.1851062774658203
cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress	23.1018695831298828
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could	31.5638275146484375
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	19.8066596984863281
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	686.5147094726562500
jane was by no means better	392.9211425781250000
she answered him with cold civility	256.3491210937500000
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	42.0713615417480469
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	8.1801328659057617
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	47.2124481201171875
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	182.7458648681640625
this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue	8.3257007598876953
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	21.8829193115234375
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	5.5076494216918945
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	16.8147239685058594
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	309.5525512695312500
pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family	9.5737419128417969
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world	16.4389381408691406
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	20.5459403991699219
and she rose as she spoke	28.3593273162841797
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	451.4931945800781250
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	11.5330390930175781
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	40.7119445800781250
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again	5.3603253364562988
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	342.7730712890625000
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile	33.8437309265136719
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	9.6990346908569336
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	20.2258949279785156
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved	7.2886867523193359
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more	43.0958099365234375
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	10.9125976562500000
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	17.2632083892822266
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end	34.3293685913085938
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	44.9178504943847656
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	29.5330924987792969
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	105.3275375366210938
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	100.5313262939453125
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	379.3930969238281250
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	1.2057505846023560
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	28.9306488037109375
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	44.6470413208007812
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	283.8265075683593750
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy	7.6315550804138184
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	451.4018859863281250
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	46.2147865295410156
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility	32.1122436523437500
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise	86.1831970214843750
i am trying to make it out	1058.2740478515625000
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	55.3946189880371094
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	116.4350662231445312
in three volumes	28.4062747955322266
a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	96.5628509521484375
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	4.7452006340026855
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	38.3836059570312500
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within that sum	9.2869243621826172
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	18.6215972900390625
a few weeks he believed	76.2520675659179688
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	66.9703445434570312
such as vanity and pride	5.4902453422546387
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	20.5408573150634766
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	21.7931747436523438
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	10.9597854614257812
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	240.1713867187500000
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	70.8610076904296875
from mr collins and what can he have to say	238.0920104980468750
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	144.9234771728515625
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy	16.9622974395751953
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	74.7285537719726562
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	34.8478965759277344
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	72.0298767089843750
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	9.4027347564697266
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	2314.7255859375000000
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	5.3163914680480957
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	554.3399047851562500
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	312.1265563964843750
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	159.8522186279296875
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	1.7487345933914185
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	22.9112491607666016
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	145.7838897705078125

it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now	109.7889862060546875
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	334.0321960449218750
but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	14.8840436935424805
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	1.7886741161346436
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	450.4639892578125000
implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me	47.1200256347656250

he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	218.3594818115234375
cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	1519.2246093750000000
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone	55.3638343811035156
i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him	17.6170196533203125
did you go by the village of kympton	177.4532318115234375
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	6.3860311508178711
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence	31.6222362518310547
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	12.3791980743408203
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	9.3885555267333984
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	40.9567947387695312
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	49.1347007751464844
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	7.8992714881896973

observed mrs bennet	81.2699737548828125
as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do	28920.0722656250000000
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	18.6359558105468750
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley	10.8586196899414062
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	64.5911560058593750
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	65.4633483886718750
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	62.1892814636230469
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	17.7568778991699219
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	804.2681884765625000
my dearest lizzy	46.4703674316406250
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	69.9269256591796875
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them	6.1553525924682617
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	15.9533605575561523
yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor	55.0478858947753906
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	2.0144586563110352
but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	9.2874593734741211
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	74.8834762573242188
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	142.1003417968750000
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	4.0844550132751465
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library	9.7637805938720703
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	49.8716812133789062
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	90.0349044799804688
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	32.3701972961425781
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	33.9329452514648438
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	42.8035430908203125
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	142.3173217773437500
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	29.9608535766601562
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	26.5513076782226562
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	188.1164093017578125
wickham only shook his head	268.3027343750000000
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am	9.6660528182983398
mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2.8797373771667480
to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	35.4308662414550781
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me	50.4719581604003906
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	116.5924606323242188
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend	180.8978881835937500
their reception at home was most kind	35.4899787902832031
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	61.9409866333007812
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	12.8328304290771484
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in laws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	532.4386596679687500
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals	132.9210968017578125
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says	3.5668113231658936
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	33.7286682128906250
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune	620.1256103515625000
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	76.5740127563476562
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	25.0557804107666016
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	220.0452575683593750
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	28.3321418762207031
the path just admitted three	3.3683373928070068
if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	34.0550689697265625
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	1904.5898437500000000
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	47.1015663146972656
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	6.8526887893676758
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	123.9673004150390625
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	21.4478034973144531
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	17.1570320129394531
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	67.4050598144531250
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	1224.0419921875000000
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	11.2688770294189453
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	14.3229799270629883
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	130.3962402343750000
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	88.9453201293945312
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself	68.1321258544921875
i will make no promise of the kind	305.3419494628906250
oh jane take care	158.6019592285156250
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	6.1370487213134766
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	106.0293884277343750
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	127.1044082641601562
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	272.0335693359375000
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful	30.4153671264648438
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	26.1992454528808594
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	6.7380728721618652
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	4.9611363410949707
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	3.0913369655609131
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	1.1726835966110229
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	55.2439498901367188
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	4.2019371986389160
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	405.8866577148437500
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	46.5509300231933594
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	5.6934528350830078
do you prefer reading to cards	22.5146350860595703
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	6.2003893852233887
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	2768.3527832031250000
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	167.2402648925781250
i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself	1.8138735294342041
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	242.8621673583984375
<num> d the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	173.7696533203125000
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	262.4506530761718750
mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	4.2484850883483887
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	20.7975826263427734
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent	345.6245727539062500
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	8.3958959579467773
lady catherine seemed resigned	76.1267318725585938
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well	3.1901288032531738
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	129.2879943847656250
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	8.8772029876708984
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	11.1703224182128906
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	2255.9013671875000000
the second began	37.4280776977539062
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	19.5520000457763672
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	38.7608489990234375
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	20.1864261627197266
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	226.4146423339843750
no one made any reply	43.5539817810058594
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	3.1185598373413086
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	9.4373712539672852
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under	4.1609911918640137
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	77.7173385620117188
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance	16.6455879211425781
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	667.4291992187500000
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone	48.8562088012695312
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	4.3826122283935547
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	895.4001464843750000
my dear dear lydia	2866.0500488281250000
it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows	151.4141998291015625
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	10.0989828109741211
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	334.6829833984375000
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	30.4542388916015625
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	13.3890733718872070
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	97.0084075927734375
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	49.8093910217285156
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened	8.4285554885864258
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	11.4716405868530273
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	51.1501464843750000
they followed her into the dining parlour	74.2536926269531250
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	47.1826858520507812
sir william did not say much	287.1365356445312500
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	23.8079338073730469
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	1.2026033401489258
i had much rather go in the coach	6.7299675941467285
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	9.4347753524780273
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	165.4087066650390625
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate	834.3652343750000000
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	4.2317075729370117
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	68.3960876464843750
i must not decide on my own performance	25.5576076507568359
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	850.7866210937500000
he shook his head	6.3571043014526367
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	254.1912536621093750
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	13.5793085098266602
i can guess the subject of your reverie	4141.6591796875000000
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	7.8662447929382324
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	734.1538085937500000
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	46.4281196594238281
good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	18.9568786621093750
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions	8.6412420272827148
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	24.2851619720458984
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	35.5548591613769531
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	2.5639972686767578
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	1.2553538084030151
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	1.3751772642135620
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	490.5569458007812500
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	94.1546020507812500
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	58.8365249633789062
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them	774.0545043945312500
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	66.5875854492187500
he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	133.1455993652343750
gracechurch street sept <num>	893.3403320312500000
what do you mean	230.5922393798828125
at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	43.5756263732910156
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	37.7482719421386719
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	97.6060714721679688
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	35.4727973937988281
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	64.6134567260742188
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly	5.4434456825256348
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	82.5027236938476562
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	12.1146907806396484
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	11.7081995010375977
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet	2.6852784156799316
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	58.5153007507324219
however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <url> you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form	69.9428405761718750
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation	38.2188987731933594
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said	8.5249977111816406
do you certainly leave kent on saturday	8.9494104385375977
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this	174.2638702392578125
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	320.4238891601562500
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility	7.5277552604675293
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	45.9965209960937500
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know	111.6228256225585938
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk	26.4646148681640625
from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	28.2037162780761719
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	1935.6309814453125000
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children	9.1310825347900391
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	66.0376815795898438
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	64.7634277343750000
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	409.6732482910156250
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	9.2428932189941406
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	235.4910278320312500
that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	39.4139976501464844
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers	41.2323722839355469
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	168.8743896484375000
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	3.0870153903961182
does that young lady know mr darcy	313.3762512207031250
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	443.1085815429687500
she replied in the affirmative	9.5938367843627930
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	1059.4216308593750000
her ladyship was highly incensed	60.6348495483398438
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	280.9618530273437500
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	7.7199006080627441
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	52.7696990966796875
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	442.8616638183593750
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	165.7656707763671875
mr bingley followed his advice	63.8198394775390625
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	46.7856788635253906
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	57.6721458435058594
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	27.1887969970703125
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	20.4522342681884766
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	3.5794603824615479
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	46.8098907470703125
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	24.4815635681152344
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	1364.7598876953125000
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	129.3402862548828125
she declared her resolution	513.1784057617187500
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	119.4934234619140625
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	88.1303482055664062
you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	18.8085556030273438
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	62.9487266540527344
i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	35.1682243347167969
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	279.7926940917968750
project gutenberg tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u s unless a copyright notice is included	677.5550537109375000
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	501.4607849121093750
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	84.6514282226562500
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed	6.8142962455749512
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	179.7336273193359375
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	196.7289581298828125
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	11.9232330322265625
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	15.1603822708129883
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	14.5058841705322266
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	7.1657466888427734
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	3.8346176147460938
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	424.3811340332031250
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	70.5453109741210938
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st	1377.4880371093750000
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	215.6568908691406250
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him	6.8893475532531738
she went on	1.5391525030136108
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family	122.2088928222656250
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	139.9218139648437500
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	6.8764371871948242
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	176.2379302978515625
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends	15.1552171707153320
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	29.7685546875000000
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will think no more about him	300.5270385742187500
this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	156.9415283203125000
information about the mission of project gutenberg tm	16.1873378753662109
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	96.3702239990234375
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	38.4499168395996094
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	128.8208007812500000
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	268.9795837402343750
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long	33.9928207397460938
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much	351.6705322265625000
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	6.5537705421447754
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	10.6559782028198242
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	2.9782736301422119
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	81.9094085693359375
repeated miss bingley	18.5908737182617188
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	228.3448028564453125
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	81.2945480346679688
yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	84.5489120483398438
what could become of mr bingley and jane	175.3322448730468750
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	140.8267974853515625
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	19.8445186614990234
illustration morning dress	395.6446228027343750
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	21.7908420562744141
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	18.4997825622558594
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	1306.6688232421875000
i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks	16.2997703552246094
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	680.4742431640625000
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	286.2801818847656250
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	10.3108463287353516
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	42.2129173278808594
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	12.0670833587646484
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	73.0660400390625000
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again	111.3644485473632812
yes but he seemed to like his second better	100.3309555053710938
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	7.4375109672546387
elizabeth silently attended her	293.7682800292968750
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	42.4039688110351562
mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	12.5462970733642578
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	5.9445891380310059
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	22.1074867248535156
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	25.4535884857177734
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	50.1185913085937500
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	22.9085330963134766
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	10.6738204956054688
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do	79.6757965087890625
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	2030.2947998046875000
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	509.7960205078125000
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	116.4307937622070312
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence	10.8628559112548828
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with	923.8598632812500000
indeed i do not dare	156.2972564697265625
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before	15.3043489456176758
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	1030.9729003906250000
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	562.9296264648437500
she dared not even mention that gentleman	181.1551971435546875
he begged pardon for having displeased her	4.9723334312438965
you were mr bingleys first choice	233.1570129394531250
repeated mr bennet	17.9756641387939453
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever	128.1035003662109375
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	50.4128036499023438
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	42.2264099121093750
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	8.7560176849365234
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice	19.5181674957275391
elizabeth was distressed	80.6073074340820312
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	11.2954463958740234
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	5.4045844078063965
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding	777.2518920898437500
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	311.3177795410156250
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	4.5929446220397949
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	4.7787847518920898
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	173.6657714843750000
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	21.8003044128417969
no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	41.1548347473144531
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	71.0081787109375000
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	50.5375709533691406
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	18.1400127410888672
mr bennet treated the matter differently	6.9331979751586914
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	5.5135011672973633
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	120.8842697143554688
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	11.3536977767944336
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	159.2505798339843750
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	101.3991622924804688
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	6.0749740600585938
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeths intimate friend	18.4674186706542969
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	330.3160095214843750
oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	5113.7246093750000000
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	21.0415191650390625
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	23.7263298034667969
there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	23.7051486968994141
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution	155.6420440673828125
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	53.4625778198242188
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	4.2102670669555664
cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest	14.9990320205688477
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work	39.7030220031738281
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived	833.5774536132812500
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	1.4973677396774292
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	22.3993434906005859
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	173.3028717041015625
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips	40.2348327636718750
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	192.8320770263671875
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	48.5140228271484375
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	36.6780014038085938
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd	186.1972503662109375
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	22.9177875518798828
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them	122.9606018066406250
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	122.6730499267578125
my dear brother	572.5317382812500000
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	70.3452072143554688
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	5.4172821044921875
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	646.7431030273437500
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	35.7488555908203125
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	28.6958312988281250
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	1.2617827653884888
i should like it beyond any thing	10.6371049880981445
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	5.1070227622985840
yes she did	135.6060333251953125
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	1244.7048339843750000
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	30.8738384246826172
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	234.6384735107421875
you are too hasty sir she cried	9.7067632675170898
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	10.8550853729248047
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence	6.3844900131225586
yes almost every day	135.3649139404296875
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num> f<num>	27.6907405853271484
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	9.1044912338256836
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	32.8920288085937500
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	637.9035644531250000
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	59.0131187438964844
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal	36.8070373535156250
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	36.1270828247070312
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	656.0484619140625000
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	163.2342376708984375
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	5248.5854492187500000
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	49.3479499816894531
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would	71.5922622680664062
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said	128.7096710205078125
these were the contents	15.8759346008300781
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	5.2805762290954590
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	636.9643554687500000
elizabeth felt janes pleasure	703.6332397460937500
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	160.3144226074218750
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together	5.2285604476928711
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh	104.2791442871093750
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	35.6656570434570312
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	178.5839843750000000
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcys	30.0549831390380859
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	5.8727054595947266
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	26.2279014587402344
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	155.5728912353515625
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	196.5203552246093750
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	35.6759986877441406
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	160.8712768554687500
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	41.8313827514648438
lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	1.2835630178451538
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	8.7866878509521484
jane shook her head	19.0561809539794922
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	164.2946929931640625
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	9.3860359191894531
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	8.0713672637939453
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	11.4364414215087891
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	14.8105268478393555
he bore it however with admirable calmness	238.8451080322265625
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself	5.6055774688720703
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr darcy	18.7566986083984375
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	13.8718862533569336
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	1021.6998291015625000
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	52.7107658386230469
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	100.8771972656250000
by the author of sense and sensibility	470.2581176757812500
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <num> e<num>	93.2580871582031250
and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case	844.7976684570312500

oh where where is my uncle	36.1703491210937500
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	439.1209411621093750
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	4.3029856681823730
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	462.3084716796875000
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	23.1344928741455078
and have you answered the letter	432.7118835449218750
said he hastily as he opened the door	47.0834579467773438
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	264.4068298339843750
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	354.3963012695312500
and is this all	3.5584216117858887
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	11.6454219818115234
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	15.9832496643066406
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home	18.3692836761474609
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	11.6581888198852539
and you saw him frequently	11.6632881164550781
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	34.4523925781250000
said he as he joined her	14.1707267761230469
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you	695.9511718750000000
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	139.1480255126953125
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	17.6415500640869141
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	4.3318858146667480
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	3.8362522125244141
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	33.2649040222167969
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	38.2389678955078125
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection	125.5421524047851562
jane looked at her doubtingly	115.8568191528320312
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	4.2620034217834473
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	29.5482769012451172
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	204.5625305175781250
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	25.1566200256347656
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	16.7499084472656250
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	542.5689697265625000
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time	105.7884063720703125
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point	76.0456085205078125
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	8.8039398193359375
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	5.7535805702209473
is my father in town	251.4114990234375000
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tms goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come	36.2299079895019531
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	52.6138610839843750
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	9.3287572860717773
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is <num>	33.6015739440917969
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	1638.9788818359375000
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	131.0520019531250000
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west salt lake city ut <num> <num> <num>	12.1348505020141602
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	75.2600631713867188
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months	17.4341487884521484
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	1.1645236015319824
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet	244.2550048828125000
the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	54.9604949951171875
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	387.3679199218750000
she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	1.5749187469482422
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	85.4615173339843750
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	17.3425922393798828
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth	76.5621109008789062
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	46.2302284240722656
jane now came up	170.8709716796875000
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	33.7061920166015625
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	4.3832406997680664
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	5.8197159767150879
cried elizabeth when she had finished	734.5457153320312500
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost	214.2575836181640625
you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	78.0051803588867188
by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	89.8296203613281250
charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture	7.3111100196838379
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	33.3904991149902344
very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	13.7787952423095703
yes in conjunction with his friend	234.3043975830078125
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	11.6703538894653320
cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way	96.0168914794921875
how so how can it affect them	3.4276278018951416
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	34.9062423706054688
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	135.5713653564453125
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	3.6171605587005615
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	1.9168761968612671
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	46.7517356872558594
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	63.5683555603027344
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	160.3124389648437500
it was then disclosed in the following manner	4.3742618560791016
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home	2.2733716964721680
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	41.8220520019531250
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	1420.6531982421875000
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said	364.9570617675781250
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	81.3593063354492188
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	11.8392448425292969
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am	70.2568435668945312
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	14.7072296142578125
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	68.1445693969726562
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both	12.0755968093872070
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation	467.9744262695312500
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	128.4094085693359375
mr collins made his declaration in form	7.4151148796081543
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil	40.2516250610351562
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	386.9580383300781250
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	31.4485168457031250
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	119.0531082153320312
darcy mentioned his letter	368.4103088378906250
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley	312.1265563964843750
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her	52.5033340454101562
it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	1.4626806974411011
how can you be smiling so lizzy	1.6926690340042114
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	5.8793087005615234
it was all pride and insolence	42.5536231994628906
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther	299.4516601562500000
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject	1.5982987880706787
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	9.4964895248413086
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	12.9108657836914062
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	15.8092212677001953
updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed	68.8520355224609375
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	35.8342514038085938
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	42.8310317993164062
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	392.7162170410156250
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	40.7346839904785156
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	721.7799682617187500
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	173.3908233642578125
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	97.4210052490234375
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	21.3321552276611328
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	3.9180350303649902
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now	80.5424194335937500
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	7.2431964874267578
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	22.2655353546142578
project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers	3.2986881732940674
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	107.9761581420898438
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	2.1370475292205811
his doing so drew her notice	49.8324470520019531
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	11.5653638839721680
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	52.5406875610351562
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	5.0104780197143555
the letter was to this effect	79.1520538330078125
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	384.8677978515625000
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	28.5702323913574219
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	14.8709011077880859
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	347.0203247070312500
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	7.3354830741882324
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	356.9913024902343750
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	33.7322692871093750
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	190.6432495117187500
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	116.9471969604492188
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair	98.8829574584960938
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families	327.0772705078125000
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	181.2511901855468750
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	1040.1995849609375000
what could be the meaning of it	23.8814468383789062
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	890.7015380859375000
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	7.5944352149963379
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	463.2626953125000000
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite	280.2488403320312500
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	82.3739089965820312
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	1053.3251953125000000
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	6.0433030128479004
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	895.3554077148437500
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases	83.3090209960937500
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	11.4737253189086914
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	23.9224987030029297
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	9.1870965957641602
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	110.1431961059570312
both changed colour one looked white the other red	69.2415618896484375
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	9.0837287902832031
her reflections were in general satisfactory	13.1802520751953125
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	1314.3142089843750000
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	205.8406066894531250
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	15.8185110092163086
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	65.2074813842773438
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	25.6379852294921875
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	5.8286581039428711
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	60.3881492614746094
but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	624.7816772460937500
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	21.3814105987548828
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	675.2237548828125000
mr bennet replied that he had not	221.0788726806640625
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	14.6659431457519531
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	45.4443588256835938
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	8.2487411499023438
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin	98.5675888061523438
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	111.2753295898437500
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	3.6797549724578857
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	9.1130571365356445
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	20.0804080963134766
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	142.9164581298828125
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	288.8157958984375000
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better	63.1756706237792969
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	12.5677795410156250
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	21.5630359649658203
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	37.3409919738769531
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	103.7348403930664062
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	10.0916080474853516
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	1.3570188283920288
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	13.4628963470458984
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	10.5994682312011719
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	63.0276069641113281
<num> b project gutenberg is a registered trademark	4.2487201690673828
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	14.9027662277221680
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	6.6942191123962402
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	2.4171597957611084
perfectly so i thank you	36.2925796508789062
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus	34.8051834106445312
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	25.6592712402343750
this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	9.8937788009643555
sir william only smiled	245.4683685302734375
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	8.0624532699584961
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	42.0898284912109375
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	668.0427246093750000
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	16.4675331115722656
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added	98.4096527099609375
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	47.3207206726074219
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	3431.1926269531250000
end of the second volume	56.6101417541503906
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	94.3560256958007812
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	42.5677413940429688
other schemes too came into her head	279.3451538085937500
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	313.8233947753906250
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	206.2854309082031250
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	569.0356445312500000
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	31.8063907623291016
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	51.3100280761718750
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	540.1605224609375000
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness	34.4303359985351562
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	264.3480834960937500
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	502.1959228515625000
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	17.1119556427001953
i should imagine not	504.4269409179687500
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	182.0234985351562500

the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	20.9350624084472656
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation	9.3444290161132812
elizabeth was delighted	118.8682937622070312
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit	59.5908737182617188
when this was done she had a less active part to play	107.3147888183593750
i am dear sir c c	68.3077926635742188
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	11.9243764877319336
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	5.1070227622985840
said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	189.0462188720703125
of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	412.8314514160156250
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	29.6684455871582031
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	30.8284816741943359
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	61.4353103637695312
if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	93.5270156860351562
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	29.7202816009521484
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	17.1933517456054688
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	115.2315979003906250
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	3.8404316902160645
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	57.6819877624511719
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	13.4978017807006836
it was gratitude	70.1680221557617188
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	66.7117614746093750
i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	4.4136924743652344
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	45.8290977478027344
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	29.4007625579833984
mr bennet protested against any description of finery	75.1692428588867188
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town	52.4551887512207031
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	1.5915651321411133
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does	22.1282997131347656
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps	83.6570205688476562
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	73.8271331787109375
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	91.1516036987304688
but what is to be done about pemberley	3.9180350303649902
the loo table however did not appear	32.4593658447265625
i never heard that it was	81.4380187988281250
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	8.8527250289916992
a man who had felt less might	80.2894515991210938
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	127.5178680419921875
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	38.6206703186035156
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	12.5540094375610352
how could you begin	241.2539978027343750
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	19.1247196197509766
said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	29.1406784057617188
but self though it would intrude could not engross her	20.9339561462402344
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	213.2578735351562500
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	221.6723175048828125
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	4.7758693695068359
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused	24.7560691833496094
i have sir	16.8042812347412109
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said	127.0901107788085938
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	34.8914413452148438
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	58.1663932800292969
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	4.5505213737487793
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	5.1016602516174316
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	20.7015686035156250
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	50.5833435058593750
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear	13.4580211639404297
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	17.7898273468017578
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	10.4246349334716797
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	20.6437854766845703
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study	8.4062652587890625
jamess had made him courteous	15.4681072235107422
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	26.2561912536621094
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	472.5074157714843750
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	109.0534667968750000
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	1419.3510742187500000
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks	120.9567413330078125
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	41.5708465576171875
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	3.5023279190063477
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course	31.7530479431152344
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	125.2246932983398438
if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is derived from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges	21.1006946563720703
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	18.1685543060302734
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	171.4437408447265625
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	61.9219322204589844
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	11.1613588333129883
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	4.2985887527465820
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	14.6323375701904297
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	4.3989849090576172
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	357.1577758789062500
the foundations principal office is located at <num> melan dr s fairbanks ak <num> but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations	21.5761489868164062
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	23.8910255432128906
i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	300.9421997070312500
she directly replied	40.4424591064453125
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	8.8872041702270508
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	9.3253202438354492
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character	5.0955681800842285
oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you	7.0994338989257812

and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	288.1303710937500000
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	129.7245788574218750
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	25.9420585632324219
the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	1607.7443847656250000
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	14.2227840423583984
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	8.5555191040039062
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	134.5848693847656250
in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	14.3117189407348633
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	49.3734588623046875

illustration a vicarage house	4.5656652450561523
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	254.8775939941406250
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	117.6839294433593750
is he married or single	51.2106819152832031
said he smiling	30.0891704559326172
elizabeth could bear it no longer	275.0961608886718750
you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	20.2874584197998047
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	8.8452358245849609
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	10.7491550445556641
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	92.9318161010742188
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	15.5320873260498047
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	6.4128365516662598
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered	35.8411102294921875
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	159.3435516357421875
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	5.1282911300659180
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	3.2771592140197754
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	1131.5529785156250000
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	182.1997985839843750

by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	6.3381280899047852
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	8.0524282455444336
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	11.3444967269897461
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out	14.1481857299804688
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	11.9497451782226562
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	410.7173461914062500
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys	92.3818359375000000

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	549.8914794921875000
yes very handsome	832.7483520507812500
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	24.9074687957763672
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	89.1401672363281250
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	340.2783203125000000
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	74.6313400268554688
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	17.0640792846679688
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	51.4772834777832031
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	40.2218284606933594
i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	182.1343841552734375
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	7.3643579483032227
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	193.1962738037109375
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	13.8103618621826172
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	219.5855255126953125
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	42.4327507019042969
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	947.5480346679687500
mrs collins knew not what to make of him	102.5076675415039062
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	26.5123405456542969
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	43.2680931091308594
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	8.8220767974853516
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	135.4806976318359375
as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	159.4155120849609375
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	7.9522061347961426
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	11.0461654663085938
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange	92.0037612915039062

with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	2.4387593269348145
she was gone directly	141.7695159912109375
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	923.6835937500000000
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	18.9812221527099609
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	375.2050170898437500
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia	247.5887908935546875
is that his design in settling here	20.6454200744628906
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged	12.2206115722656250
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	111.1376647949218750
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable	17.4428272247314453
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she	93.7498703002929688
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	2.7971639633178711
said elizabeth to herself	18.3743991851806641
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	43.2494888305664062
they were to be off as soon as possible	368.2478942871093750
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long	175.8544769287109375
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	7.3470520973205566
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	50.7995719909667969
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	18.8285808563232422
well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	15.3768033981323242
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	17.8885364532470703
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	148.7967224121093750
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other	42.5256462097167969
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	647.1395263671875000
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it	76.9675445556640625
i am talking of possibilities charles	13.5829181671142578
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller	180.2490997314453125
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling	132.3476562500000000
what is it you mean	30.2140350341796875
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it	101.5836791992187500
that is a failing indeed	1123.1889648437500000
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	45.1867370605468750
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	24.2169132232666016
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	782.9783325195312500
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	15.3598308563232422
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	95.1923446655273438
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	3859.9904785156250000
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	213.2792358398437500
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	28.0944957733154297
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	161.9351348876953125
my dear jane	134.2710876464843750
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said	37.5714378356933594
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at <url>	124.4045486450195312
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	22.1329784393310547
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	103.8362426757812500
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case	8.8010559082031250
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	84.5927886962890625
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself	6.8395285606384277
<num> e unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg	5.2683577537536621
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	81.8541259765625000
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	260.7312927246093750
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	35.0936126708984375
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	7.3643579483032227
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	49.2341880798339844
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses	88.6246643066406250
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	63.0868949890136719
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference	26.6937522888183594
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet	295.9849243164062500
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	1.3841521739959717
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	79.5110931396484375
but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	1192.3763427734375000
said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	79.0078201293945312
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you	126.2265777587890625
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	33.3614807128906250
she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife	3.9476809501647949
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	1.8001295328140259
then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	27.4854450225830078
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	46.3123970031738281
can it be possible that he will marry her	30.3899402618408203
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	39.3694305419921875
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	81.0438156127929688
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	102.2756042480468750
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	178.0550384521484375
elizabeth now began to revive	32.2063827514648438
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	435.9921875000000000
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	25.9237461090087891
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	26.4767971038818359
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	29.9916687011718750
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	535.0193481445312500
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	132.9254150390625000
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	395.0483398437500000
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	64.1459808349609375
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	2.9055337905883789
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	69.4099197387695312
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	22.7370967864990234
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy	50.8976097106933594
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	277.4132690429687500
cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	11.5621595382690430
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	198.2641754150390625
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	102.3399505615234375
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution	6.6460404396057129
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	30.7882652282714844
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	8.1529350280761719
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	31.9706878662109375
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	12.3006772994995117
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	1299.4227294921875000
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	331.5471496582031250
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	140.5230560302734375
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	102.7541732788085938
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	203.9446716308593750
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs foot stool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <num> per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	20.9479808807373047
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	1062.9642333984375000
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	26.8291759490966797
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying	13.9701128005981445
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	2.5634908676147461
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	21.4343242645263672
i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family	19.2418956756591797
a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	6.5461521148681641
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her	6.1442017555236816
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	67.7287521362304688
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	224.0013427734375000
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	58.5153007507324219
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	250.6126708984375000
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	98.7116622924804688
in what an amiable light does this place him	91.3660964965820312
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	11.9536876678466797
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	24.9001407623291016
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do	1.2170643806457520
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	32.5473518371582031
it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think	5.9800429344177246
how nicely we are crammed in	15.5131111145019531
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	351.3304748535156250
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	47.8158264160156250
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	654.6091308593750000
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	8.8979339599609375
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	413.8131103515625000
cried miss bingley	539.5709838867187500
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion	4.2393760681152344
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	313.4817810058593750
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets	42.5299606323242188
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	9.7822122573852539
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	125.1638488769531250
i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	4.7040424346923828
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	30.4918804168701172
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	248.4239501953125000
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	216.7267303466796875
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect	219.4818878173828125
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	105.3487319946289062
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	267.4997253417968750
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	10.0312004089355469
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well	1.2804955244064331
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	39.2789077758789062
