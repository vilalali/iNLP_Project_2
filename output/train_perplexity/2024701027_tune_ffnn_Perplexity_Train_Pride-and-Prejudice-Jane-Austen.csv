mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire	4809.2495117187500000
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	54.1312255859375000
i am glad you are come back lizzy	88.8191986083984375
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	10894.8066406250000000
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	14.2092723846435547
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	2080.6689453125000000
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	2462.8850097656250000
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	903.0599975585937500
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	727.0642700195312500
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	18.6466598510742188
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	250.7935638427734375
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	1430.6285400390625000
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	109.3064804077148438
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	2464.6601562500000000
elizabeth immediately began playing again	580.4528808593750000
just as you please	581.0311279296875000
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	54.8612098693847656
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	8530.0585937500000000
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	1123.3309326171875000
and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me	2494.1552734375000000
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	359.3520507812500000
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	2610.2214355468750000
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	56.9134750366210938
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	39.2145423889160156
and what did she say	60.3403091430664062
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	23.3505134582519531
oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs	9762.6806640625000000
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	5693.8964843750000000
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	300.9165344238281250
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	439.7861022949218750
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	113.3927993774414062
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	99.9323120117187500
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	23.7765922546386719
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	3021.0537109375000000
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	30.1318988800048828
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	382.1947937011718750
indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night	49.9193878173828125
everything wore a happier aspect	139.2226867675781250
bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	277.4995117187500000
that is not very likely our authority was too good	146.2577667236328125
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	27.2941818237304688
sir william had been delighted with him	8294.0087890625000000
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	1386.2272949218750000
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	73.5000457763671875
one of them does	32.3631134033203125
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	3636.1296386718750000

oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson	73.1076889038085938
if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	817.2428588867187500
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation	12.4296541213989258
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	47.2883758544921875
what can be the meaning of this	17.7982692718505859
wickham lydia were all forgotten	86.7784194946289062
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	95.7534027099609375
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	319.6446838378906250
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	11.5848159790039062
yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases	148.0563507080078125
true are the others coming out	5.6482195854187012
no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	860.5852050781250000
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	18.7578716278076172
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	315.4732971191406250
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	8152.8554687500000000
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states	80.8710327148437500
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	2859.2700195312500000
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	49.6913108825683594
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	6805.7583007812500000
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	50.0718994140625000
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	96.3377838134765625
jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman	124.9080200195312500
what would she have said how would she have behaved	12.9394073486328125
but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	2396.4804687500000000
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	299.2737426757812500
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	36.7315788269042969
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	268.7226562500000000
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	198.8826751708984375
london printed for t egerton military library whitehall	258.8976440429687500
the tête à tête surprised them	157.3984832763671875
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	187.9858703613281250
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	221.0877227783203125
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	46.2502822875976562
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	1350.8720703125000000
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	1236.9031982421875000
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	18.7315120697021484
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	8835.2099609375000000
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	81.4564361572265625
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	2039.7480468750000000
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	514.7041625976562500
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	2902.5246582031250000
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	10.9074134826660156
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	4584.3115234375000000
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	2596.8164062500000000
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	2776.7663574218750000
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy	1491.3320312500000000
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	57696.9882812500000000
not yet replied jane	878.0987548828125000
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better	4768.1386718750000000
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said	42.0023345947265625
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	1435.1085205078125000
it was as follows	46.9691772460937500
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him	588.2084960937500000
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	36.2801132202148438
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	3101.4624023437500000
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	89.6946258544921875
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	208.3086090087890625
see <file name> or <file name> <url> or <url>	1304.4145507812500000
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	83.5406188964843750
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	46.6479759216308594
from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	2979.1660156250000000
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	18.4123439788818359
indeed i have sir was her answer	17765.8984375000000000
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	938.5324707031250000
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	55.4793167114257812
may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	193.4091033935546875
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	141.5166473388671875
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	2709.8144531250000000
and do you impute it to either of those	207.8601226806640625
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	511.0753173828125000
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	1295.9803466796875000
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	56.4941329956054688
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	16.6801986694335938
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	39.0084114074707031
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	15.4439373016357422
i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true	2643.0134277343750000
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	692.5599365234375000
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	559.5693359375000000
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been	798.5079345703125000
yes or i will never see her again	21.3436088562011719
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	166.9455413818359375
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	160.9306640625000000
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed	2166.5246582031250000
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	59.9617042541503906
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	5311.2241210937500000
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	1991.0983886718750000
mrs hurst thought the same and added	21.4693737030029297
yet why did he come	77.8863296508789062
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	354.1726074218750000
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	5602.4677734375000000
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	216.7622070312500000
were questions with which she amused herself	326.3255920410156250
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend	335.3635253906250000
mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all	148.9258575439453125
at length the parsonage was discernible	605.2315673828125000
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	30.0448112487792969
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point	281.2378540039062500
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	21.1187667846679688
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest	47.5129089355468750
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	24.2983970642089844
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	4095.4260253906250000
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	203.3008270263671875
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	24.7136421203613281
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	166.6880645751953125
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	5623.6440429687500000
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	24162.4707031250000000
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	56.8032302856445312
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	5.0755591392517090
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	253.8173370361328125
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	110.3404846191406250
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	8674.6240234375000000
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	2557.7612304687500000
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	6772.3168945312500000
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	33.7472114562988281
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	181.7039642333984375
oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	94.7050933837890625
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	1826.7929687500000000
my uncle is to send a servant for us	37.3745765686035156
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	206.9973602294921875
in three volumes	849.1699218750000000
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	247.1276092529296875
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	2488.2145996093750000
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	2143.5600585937500000
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	53.4731330871582031
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	32.0307312011718750
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm	77.8528289794921875
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying	306438.5312500000000000
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted	60.2662963867187500
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	122.6631011962890625
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	1824.8516845703125000
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	423.3742065429687500
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	4619.3984375000000000
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	15607.2207031250000000
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	48.1792755126953125
her father lifted up his eyes	365.4915466308593750
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	795.1469116210937500
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	25306.5058593750000000
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	71.3030548095703125
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	17.9848003387451172
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	144.2971649169921875
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	3233.3190917968750000
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	19.0479698181152344
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game	664.3973388671875000
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	1882.3880615234375000
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	97.6079864501953125
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	413.7491760253906250
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	6.0603051185607910
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said	108.1751480102539062
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you	2895.3645019531250000
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	16.2636699676513672
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	1304.4145507812500000
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	1334.3013916015625000
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	140.6721649169921875
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth	30855.4160156250000000
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	227.5662994384765625
cried mrs gardiner	106.3689804077148438
there was also a postscript to this effect	562.5834960937500000
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made	134.4775390625000000
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	472.1641540527343750
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	276.4551086425781250
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties	725.9328613281250000
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	113.8336181640625000
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	5694.2382812500000000
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	80.7879714965820312
very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet	1333.7125244140625000
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	4325.0541992187500000
no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner	45.4058456420898438
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	954.6832275390625000
occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	11.1363353729248047
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	45.9451599121093750
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	1398.0806884765625000
do you really think so	593.3427124023437500
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	5240.6879882812500000
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	339.3856506347656250
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	101.7376480102539062
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	1947.4273681640625000
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	700.3731689453125000
you are severe on us	17.3783893585205078
good god what is the matter	158.1390380859375000
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	600.8251953125000000
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	1147.3912353515625000
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	3758.8730468750000000
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	2690.2116699218750000
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	7369.2993164062500000
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	4165.8549804687500000
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying	26.6068630218505859
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	31.2122211456298828
yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	1043.6788330078125000
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	610.4171142578125000
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them	86.8056945800781250
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	412.2145690917968750
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast	5066.8261718750000000
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	99.3794250488281250
mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last	40.3249816894531250
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	76.4653930664062500
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	34.9933052062988281
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	967.7485351562500000
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	139.6573333740234375
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable	1282.6823730468750000
author jane austen	6649.6435546875000000
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak	61.5356369018554688
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	6327.2421875000000000
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	14474.8476562500000000
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love	7401.6635742187500000
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	754.5247802734375000
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	1598.7919921875000000
she certainly did not hate him	48.6539726257324219
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty	300.2431335449218750
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	887.5497436523437500
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	132.7647705078125000
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added	24.5010261535644531
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	66.2941894531250000
release date <date> ebook <hashtag>	40.3315773010253906
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	80.6526031494140625
are you not diverted	41556.4335937500000000
elizabeth was in agonies	430.2598266601562500
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	61.0055160522460938
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	144.9775238037109375
yes very well i saw them the night before last	18.6659240722656250
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	792.2720336914062500
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	109.8972549438476562
her own thoughts were employing her	7.2052459716796875
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	1082.6591796875000000
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued	7166.2524414062500000
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls	268.7226562500000000
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	44.6869430541992188
this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation	447.4796142578125000
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	10112.8037109375000000
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	340.2940673828125000
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	307.5769958496093750
and my mother how is she how are you all	76.4653930664062500
all was joy and kindness	28.0007362365722656
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	304.4707641601562500
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	1371.4426269531250000
i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	1552.2003173828125000
mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	718.1286010742187500
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	15.1643581390380859
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	56.7656745910644531
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	711.0358886718750000
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	3337.6103515625000000
it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	59.5713272094726562
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	395.5186462402343750
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	144.9088134765625000
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	337.6056213378906250
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	1531.2868652343750000
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	253.8173370361328125
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	14.2768106460571289
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	79.5145416259765625
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	285.1452941894531250
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled	36952.6289062500000000
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe	8.5223817825317383
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	29615.4648437500000000
but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it	66.6551895141601562
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	29.5763778686523438
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	1792.1270751953125000
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	233.8825683593750000
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	98.0709304809570312
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	39495.7382812500000000
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	8314.4101562500000000
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	10777.9052734375000000
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	16.5427742004394531
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	592.5004882812500000
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home	181.2032470703125000
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	34.2804985046386719
but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	984.0511474609375000
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home	23.3076400756835938
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	100.9587707519531250
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	744.2462158203125000
they found mr bennet still up	151.9868774414062500
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him	7826.1816406250000000
it was a rational scheme to be sure	207.6210021972656250
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any	9.9883861541748047
could i expect it to be otherwise	86.6742019653320312
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply	228.7172546386718750
it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up	2377.9440917968750000
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage	22.6874198913574219
oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	4494.6738281250000000
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	93.1962509155273438
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	39.3934211730957031
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1811.5555419921875000
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	826.5640869140625000
with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say	4463.2275390625000000
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls	102.1470336914062500
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	111.2414779663085938
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	9052.8945312500000000
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	11393.3710937500000000
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	1264.6630859375000000
how much of good or evil must be done by him	1825.8533935546875000
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	692.5599365234375000
and so was i	1201.5076904296875000
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	119.8675537109375000
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	2936.7751464843750000
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	581.2369995117187500
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	3716.5937500000000000
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	289.8125305175781250

colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	85.1442871093750000
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	175.6667327880859375
and have you heard from him often	147.7845916748046875
a great deal more passed at the other table	5438.2338867187500000
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	3464.0117187500000000
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	69.5297393798828125
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	91.0306320190429688
they had several children	3179.1137695312500000
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it	1026.0841064453125000
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best	1300531.2500000000000000
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	32219.7480468750000000
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	65.6659698486328125
said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	3218.8835449218750000
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	48.1046104431152344
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	2418.0175781250000000
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	45194.1679687500000000
and men take care that they should	183.7815704345703125
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	9.6830682754516602
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	253.8173370361328125
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	1633.8430175781250000
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy	9520.7431640625000000
her colour changed and she said no more	518.4086303710937500
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	258.3788146972656250
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	30.3371315002441406
elizabeth you are not serious now	1720.6796875000000000
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	2572.5649414062500000
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	238.1490173339843750
there was no want of discourse	104.3314132690429688
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	68.8219375610351562
he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	125.8288650512695312
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	1160.8443603515625000
is it possible	255.0250701904296875
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	106.3896713256835938
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	2238.0319824218750000
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	58.8535270690917969
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	290.1021728515625000
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	1046.0764160156250000
the first week of their return was soon gone	9.5439691543579102
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment	6822.4721679687500000
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	698.7409667968750000
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	4931.4409179687500000
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below	190.6102447509765625
yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can	507.3007507324218750
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	19.3026714324951172
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	22.0872859954833984
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	653.6522216796875000
well and what news does it bring good or bad	9.5105714797973633
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	158.3567352294921875
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	83.4625015258789062
she was ashamed to think how much	14.1678562164306641
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	2514.2744140625000000
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her	83.5406188964843750
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	52.6052360534667969
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	38.8307189941406250
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2219.3823242187500000

it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing	22.5056037902832031
of what are you talking	8.1476049423217773
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying	1479.9416503906250000
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	26924.1503906250000000
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	31.6102924346923828
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	38.4617576599121094
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	231.7408294677734375
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	20242.8691406250000000
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	113.2320556640625000
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	31.0499343872070312
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	18.1290283203125000
i must ask whether you were surprised	1541.4737548828125000
but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	1878.9769287109375000
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity	149.7465209960937500
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	6900.1352539062500000
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	8347.4609375000000000
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	28.5967292785644531
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	27.1879959106445312
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	13975.2080078125000000
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	215.2189636230468750
no no stay where you are you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye	4073.5693359375000000
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	6736.6372070312500000
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	675.0455322265625000
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	193.4026641845703125
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	3299.1918945312500000
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	69.6404266357421875
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	749.7694091796875000
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	131.5758819580078125
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	5596.9135742187500000
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all	78.3201980590820312
we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	28.6229534149169922
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	4568.0283203125000000
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party	3787.9892578125000000
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	57.3461456298828125
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him	49.2712516784667969
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	33734.8476562500000000
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	24.3788108825683594
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	203.3008270263671875
oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	25147.8164062500000000
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	25971.3710937500000000
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	76.7377777099609375
u s laws alone swamp our small staff	393.5419921875000000
how acutely did she now feel it	752.6246337890625000
he seldom appeared really animated	15.6684131622314453
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num> f<num> this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	7084.2631835937500000
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark	47.4410171508789062
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	913.0394897460937500
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	28.8332462310791016
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed	14.8026819229125977
tis an etiquette i despise said he	2076.9023437500000000
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	73.9910888671875000
jane was distressed	38.6000022888183594
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we	3088.7021484375000000
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance	72.3596420288085938
thank you but i always mend my own	302.5097351074218750
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	478.0370483398437500
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to	472.6412658691406250
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	60.1571311950683594
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	349.8497924804687500
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	76.4653930664062500
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	23798.6464843750000000
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	6891.6650390625000000
in understanding darcy was the superior	1581.0639648437500000
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted	98.2302856445312500
their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse	15925.5527343750000000
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	191.1788177490234375
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	28.8118820190429688
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	112.7353210449218750
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living	167.5870513916015625
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	66.1761703491210938
why did she come	30690.0449218750000000
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	22.9813690185546875
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	49.1773529052734375
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	63.1902236938476562
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	4721.9682617187500000
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	98.3626022338867188
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	48.9322433471679688
oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him	3162.4431152343750000
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	34.4344825744628906
can i have the carriage	146.2577667236328125
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	28847.2128906250000000
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out	18971.8203125000000000
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawing room	1534.1993408203125000
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	1435.9224853515625000
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	61.0251846313476562
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding	14.9049854278564453
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here	113.6803207397460938
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	72.5030364990234375
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	137.4606170654296875
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	16.1239871978759766
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	31.4638843536376953
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	1074.7554931640625000
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	420.5470581054687500
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c mrs bennet was quite disconcerted	18721.8085937500000000
you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	455.7974243164062500
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	25377.2714843750000000
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	74.9710083007812500
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	359.4643554687500000
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession	10777.6591796875000000
royalty payments must be paid within <num> days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	783.7306518554687500
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable	150.8874053955078125
and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song	28.4440250396728516
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	2082.5273437500000000
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	2664.9255371093750000
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	3884.4108886718750000
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	439.0538024902343750
his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	27602.7246093750000000
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	328.5428466796875000
perhaps we might be deceived	10833.8017578125000000
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	309.8371276855468750
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1412.9967041015625000
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming	6.2064051628112793
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	60.2195281982421875
good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	14.5739736557006836
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	2200.0012207031250000
added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	85.6573104858398438
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	16269.3876953125000000
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	337.6033935546875000
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	13.9906148910522461
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	31841.9453125000000000
what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is	269.4171752929687500
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing	1834.2586669921875000
take whatever you like and get away	122.5737609863281250
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	2464.6601562500000000
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill health	76.4653930664062500
his character was decided	1336.4346923828125000
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	6425.6865234375000000
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	21.4203624725341797
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	82.3614959716796875
as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	18858.5703125000000000
money my uncle	15.1453313827514648
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	8.3144683837890625
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it	16.9258041381835938
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch	203.3008270263671875
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	69.8192443847656250
for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	184.2387237548828125
in the hall they parted	440.6358032226562500
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	186.9536437988281250
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	60.0715446472167969
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added	88.0785140991210938
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	8745.6279296875000000
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	331.5090637207031250
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	6313.3427734375000000
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	762.1745605468750000
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	91.5809020996093750
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	181.4060516357421875
catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	230.8820495605468750
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	10.6411943435668945
my dear harriet	122.4376525878906250
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	308.1924438476562500
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	20782.8222656250000000
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	69.4798889160156250
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	8.9899559020996094
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	71.0388565063476562
no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	40.9230346679687500
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	14.8985862731933594
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	146.2577667236328125
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	80.3403167724609375
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	4554.1743164062500000
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	64.8363494873046875
yet it did and even a third	236.2558441162109375
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	38.8088302612304688
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	1690.6091308593750000
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	1356.8902587890625000
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	310.3778991699218750
nearly three weeks	823.7999267578125000
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	1044.8361816406250000
how can you contrive to write so even	938.0304565429687500
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud	412.2145690917968750
the following sentence with active links to or other immediate access to the full project gutenberg tm license must appear prominently whenever any copy of a project gutenberg tm work any work on which the phrase project gutenberg appears or with which the phrase project gutenberg is associated is accessed displayed performed viewed copied or distributed	56.6730194091796875
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	20.6195087432861328
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room	4858.7514648437500000
mr wickham began the subject himself	391.6882324218750000
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	293.7361755371093750
oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	62.0468139648437500
i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir	780.5400390625000000
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	52.1455459594726562
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	35.8520507812500000
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	1589.7591552734375000
and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean	20.2983398437500000
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	6254.3979492187500000
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	127.5273742675781250
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	4634.9448242187500000
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	15840.4257812500000000
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	229.6106719970703125
lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	671.5089111328125000
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	54.7728881835937500
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	102.0444107055664062
this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it	548.7751464843750000
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	462.1255493164062500
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	4435.1884765625000000
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth	5436.5742187500000000
haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	664.8283691406250000
the girls stared at their father	1406.1602783203125000
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead	23.5942440032958984
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	43.3268699645996094
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	82.7080612182617188
you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible	5.7267980575561523
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is	37.1854286193847656
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	439.2143554687500000
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	3440.2160644531250000
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	41.5893135070800781
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	145.3023223876953125
she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness	591.0582885742187500
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	3836.9418945312500000
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	5.6580939292907715
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	2933.0859375000000000
oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	2933.0859375000000000
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	167.4930877685546875
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	1249.9351806640625000
their table was superlatively stupid	1593.3414306640625000
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	1070.3790283203125000
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	40.3763656616210938
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	15451.4072265625000000
i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased	687.1058959960937500
what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	1733.8791503906250000
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	109.4003372192382812
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	10191.9160156250000000
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings	20.4128723144531250
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	20223.8828125000000000
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	125.6650466918945312
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	361.3082275390625000
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state	1185.4187011718750000
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	98.6433868408203125
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	657.4056396484375000
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st	19814.7949218750000000
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	1827.3411865234375000
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	330.9958496093750000
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	1430.6285400390625000
nothing that she could say however had any influence	186.5627746582031250
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	18.8137454986572266
blame you oh no	46473.4023437500000000
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	1448.0349121093750000
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	140.1473999023437500
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	76.4653930664062500
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	17.2054271697998047
with the officers	11.3108596801757812
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	2131.1220703125000000
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	1703.8475341796875000
has your governess left you	440.2877807617187500
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	3888.0986328125000000
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	491.3824768066406250
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	1535.5994873046875000
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	194.8324737548828125
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	114355.9140625000000000
there was no arguing upon such a project	14.5273313522338867
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	2295.1381835937500000
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	54.7293624877929688
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance	726.0083618164062500
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them	3142.4172363281250000
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	76601.6015625000000000
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	77.6590270996093750
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added	46.9764022827148438
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	115.0287399291992188
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	1323.4117431640625000
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	287.0070800781250000
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	1893.0268554687500000
miss elizabeth bennet	1007.2912597656250000
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	62.5028686523437500
we never had any governess	78.4459686279296875
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	610.0138549804687500
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	34229.3203125000000000
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	1818.1142578125000000
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	459.4243774414062500
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	124.6661376953125000
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been	309.8371276855468750
miss bennet still looked all amazement	7.5230817794799805
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	229.2227630615234375
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	106.2757492065429688
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	29.9637260437011719
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton	789.6654663085937500
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	340.9401855468750000
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	4306.3237304687500000
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	1812.8378906250000000
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	723.0263061523437500
indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	269.9789123535156250
but still he would be her husband	1211.0490722656250000
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	18.8407096862792969
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in	4532.4667968750000000
you pay a royalty fee of <num> of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes	18.6130676269531250
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	128.8722076416015625
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	433.5611877441406250
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	98.5117263793945312
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	566.7742309570312500
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	25.3163337707519531
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	16.2283725738525391
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person	195.0119476318359375
how despicably have i acted	14.1917686462402344
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	19.4047451019287109
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there	35.7249336242675781
no not at all	352.0285644531250000
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	1568.3665771484375000
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	53.5322723388671875
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	1972.7493896484375000
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	47.5441970825195312
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected	124.7379608154296875
this will not do said elizabeth	17730.3046875000000000
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours c	1641.6876220703125000
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	2314.4418945312500000
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	1222.7294921875000000
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said	88.4066314697265625
it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	707.9846191406250000
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	681.8630981445312500
see paragraph <num> c below	3646.8781738281250000
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner	935.4745483398437500
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	723.6333618164062500
they had long wished to see him	248.6711883544921875
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	46.6828079223632812
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	10.0549278259277344
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	713.5435180664062500
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	68.7460403442382812
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	66.3944778442382812
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	15.3484754562377930
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	106.8712234497070312
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	7325.5688476562500000
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	2534.0498046875000000
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	6845.0673828125000000
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	559.5693359375000000
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them	47.5871620178222656
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill	1785.6203613281250000
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	9103.5166015625000000
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	8443.4746093750000000
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	841.3279418945312500

indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	1203.7097167968750000
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	4999.9790039062500000
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	32.0911712646484375
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	46.6956520080566406
if your master would marry you might see more of him	1259.3662109375000000
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	1363.4382324218750000
nothing could console and nothing appease her	2214.7443847656250000
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	68.5522537231445312
cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened	1719.3937988281250000
but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	548.8216552734375000
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	194.8905487060546875
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	253.2676239013671875
sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	43.3910102844238281
mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	6531.2167968750000000
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	433.5723571777343750
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation	51.5058021545410156
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	46.3025131225585938
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you	1395.5083007812500000
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	5811.4941406250000000
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	398.0638122558593750
yours sincerely c	1776.2000732421875000
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield	136.0535736083984375
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	3909.8996582031250000
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	12.7946910858154297
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	455.6493835449218750
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other	149.5111389160156250
mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	398.0638122558593750
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	52.8399467468261719
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	906.2660522460937500
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble	183.0008239746093750
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	102.9660568237304688
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	21.9827632904052734
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	216.7622070312500000
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	1376.5976562500000000
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	3325.1530761718750000
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	66.7928924560546875
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	22.9185733795166016
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	851.8701171875000000
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	501.4703979492187500
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	2094.5656738281250000
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family	39.4558067321777344
upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know	2610.8662109375000000
you are uniformly charming	722.0836181640625000
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	37.0081100463867188
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion	127.6723556518554688
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	119.7443237304687500
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	81.0675506591796875
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	27.3238048553466797
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	69.8962631225585938
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	9.9343719482421875
do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel	690.1780395507812500
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	833.7368774414062500
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	15.4544048309326172
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued	339.3856506347656250
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	25.0328464508056641
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	869.9298706054687500
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	113.8831329345703125
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	3633.1520996093750000
not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	31220.2910156250000000
though her manner varied however her determination never did	559.3842163085937500
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	306.4933166503906250
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	46.0926094055175781
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence	2690.8554687500000000
elizabeth on her side had much to do	36.0284729003906250
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	65.8648147583007812
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	127.1757049560546875
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	126.6286697387695312
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	18.9276084899902344
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	16526.6484375000000000
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	930.6968994140625000
mr wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	29164.1914062500000000
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	171.2504272460937500
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	11.4939117431640625
here she was interrupted again	92.2832565307617188
yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	4219.8427734375000000
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	528.4882202148437500
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works	9.0184192657470703
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	19.6858749389648438
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	34.7536621093750000
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	217.3037567138671875
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	219.1524658203125000
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her	590.3763427734375000
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	25645.0859375000000000
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	5247.3745117187500000
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	682.4375610351562500
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry	10.0696649551391602
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am	236.4663696289062500
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	440.6358032226562500
i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother	26.9464187622070312
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	2767.5595703125000000
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	47.7149887084960938
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	3859.5083007812500000
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	503.8043823242187500
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	23.8894481658935547
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections	1144.7210693359375000
others of the party were now applied to	2540.7575683593750000
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	40076.1015625000000000
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	6.2785825729370117
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	344.8888549804687500
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	258.8228149414062500
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	488.9996948242187500
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	869.9298706054687500
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	13.4385099411010742
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	1239.4915771484375000
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	38.1250610351562500
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	64.1643295288085938
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	326.2389526367187500
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	3337.9987792968750000
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	15.6268444061279297
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	4023.8347167968750000
lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed	149.2707824707031250
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	5438.9448242187500000
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	39700.7617187500000000
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	669.8788452148437500
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score	241.4052124023437500
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	9.6403150558471680
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	5424.5493164062500000
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	2405.2243652343750000
his words seemed to imply it	7863.0483398437500000
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	1237.1804199218750000
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	915.3594970703125000
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	128.9725036621093750
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	48.6368141174316406
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	136.5060577392578125
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	396.2569274902343750
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	87.8462295532226562
my dear niece	1811.5555419921875000
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num> e<num>	547.7308959960937500
elizabeth coloured and said a little	187.7838439941406250
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said	91.0320205688476562
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	110.6165237426757812
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	1154.3616943359375000
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	500.1354675292968750
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	179.7130584716796875
it was to this effect	1769.8374023437500000
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	190.0772857666015625
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him	2029.8435058593750000
i hope not	443.5990600585937500
but i was embarrassed	3075.8977050781250000
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	2646.1809082031250000
said jane as she finished it	26424.8027343750000000
well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	127.2686386108398438
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said	1150.4598388671875000
he drew a chair near her	40.9894714355468750
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	343.6980895996093750
on both sides it was only assertion	8.2952699661254883
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels	100.7759552001953125
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	1007.2912597656250000
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	414.4122314453125000
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	700.3731689453125000
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	10.4009838104248047
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her	4482.2089843750000000
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	22.7694034576416016
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	23.3661403656005859
said her aunt	20944.0078125000000000
mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding	18.4849777221679688
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	5067.5219726562500000
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	1158.9626464843750000
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	18.4169387817382812
he was silent	2367.6423339843750000
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	19.1059226989746094
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	58.5906295776367188
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	1653.3465576171875000
but how did he account for it	962.6702270507812500
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	4259.8730468750000000
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	1034.5234375000000000
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	63.7058181762695312
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	3568.5627441406250000
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	3941.8166503906250000
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy	742.6194458007812500
you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	117.3211975097656250
very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so	245.2550659179687500
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	150.8455352783203125
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	311.9187011718750000
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	311.0567626953125000
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	783.6940307617187500
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg tm electronic works	99.4909057617187500
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	47.4431343078613281
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	3895.0686035156250000
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	1561.2073974609375000
he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	13490.8828125000000000
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	2321.7175292968750000
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	891.1084594726562500
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	98.5117263793945312
for the liveliness of your mind i did	5.4627070426940918
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	20.2358074188232422
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	1521.5147705078125000
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	5.9323730468750000
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions	5.5362544059753418
what none of you	37828.7226562500000000
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	147.5040283203125000
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	8665.9824218750000000

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	4563.1865234375000000
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	1160.2637939453125000
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	1166.9570312500000000
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	82.2954254150390625
mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read	2183.4814453125000000
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	460.3081054687500000
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	7206.2626953125000000
come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	183.4907684326171875
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	108.8619079589843750
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	155.6485748291015625
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	21.7875328063964844
oh yes i understand you perfectly	473.7963256835937500
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	5178.3627929687500000
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	2443.3679199218750000
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	3571.5456542968750000
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued	954.6832275390625000
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time	3117.7434082031250000
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	20.0414752960205078
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	1574.4224853515625000
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	343.8936767578125000
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundations web site and official page at <url>	2630.6499023437500000
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	505.0182800292968750
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	1865.7658691406250000
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something	7252.0537109375000000
elizabeths courage did not fail her	164.0826721191406250
do not you want to know who has taken it	1255.7310791015625000
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	3263.5300292968750000
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west	73.7071838378906250
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	1106.0471191406250000
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	58.7875328063964844
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	318.4349365234375000
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest	56.5822906494140625
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	20975.0292968750000000

she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	29.9180755615234375
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	290.7857971191406250
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	51.9155387878417969
he must be an oddity i think said she	1970.9750976562500000
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	2364.8295898437500000
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said	965.4818115234375000
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words	120.8854751586914062
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell	35.1528587341308594
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday	26127.5312500000000000
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	3162.4431152343750000
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	162.1099853515625000
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	938.5324707031250000
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	4462.4912109375000000
what is his name	16.7480220794677734
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	631.2749633789062500
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	675.0455322265625000
that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	491.8257141113281250
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	264.8906555175781250
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	23.5920982360839844
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood	3156.9106445312500000
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress	16.2295951843261719
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued	36.3280944824218750
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	945.8518676757812500
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind	118.1319808959960938
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	7659.6289062500000000
you write uncommonly fast	106.2075042724609375
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	44.5812110900878906
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	501.4703979492187500
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	72.9285888671875000
i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	50.2510643005371094
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	25577.2792968750000000
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy	4223.0273437500000000
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	3435.5539550781250000
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	216.8525390625000000
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	957.6952514648437500
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	39.2338142395019531
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	46.7469444274902344
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	3747.0834960937500000
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	4934.7998046875000000
let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	138.8488311767578125
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	146.2577667236328125
she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	858.5396728515625000
his plan did not vary on seeing them	47.6366157531738281

then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married	1887.4753417968750000
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	99.2909011840820312
cried his wife impatiently	91.6838073730468750
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	507.3007507324218750
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him	34.7162055969238281
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	29111.1425781250000000
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	27.9287090301513672
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	36.1391525268554688
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	41.6895370483398438
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce	309.6517639160156250
they had frequently been staying with her in town	13.9338703155517578
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	440.6358032226562500
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	45.0379791259765625
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	307.5321350097656250
no nothing at all	73.2017669677734375
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	221.3466796875000000
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	45.5969085693359375
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	1331.3245849609375000
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	20991.8789062500000000
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	1404.0793457031250000
jane was not happy	6.2020292282104492
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise	35.8908271789550781
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	2166.5246582031250000
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	3245.2187500000000000
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	153.6899719238281250
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town	240.4419250488281250
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	180.5449981689453125
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	22.1876621246337891
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	4034.9172363281250000
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	69.6755676269531250
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	144.5330047607421875
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	310.6712341308593750
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	290.8630371093750000
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	137.7865753173828125
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	2836.8374023437500000
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	3201.6350097656250000
see paragraph <num> e below	18.7171821594238281
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	10923.2294921875000000
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	43.1137847900390625
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	57865.2773437500000000
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	258.7939758300781250
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	21.0876083374023438
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	1398.0806884765625000
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	123.8260345458984375
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it	9298.3242187500000000
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	138.1437988281250000
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	85.5920639038085938
and quite alone have all her friends left her	77.2962036132812500
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	238.0536346435546875
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said	10477.1337890625000000
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	69.5176696777343750
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	1550.8863525390625000
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	8320.5644531250000000
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	1405.3808593750000000
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	94.4883651733398438
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	13.2827262878417969
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	4488.6894531250000000
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	158.2675018310546875
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	188.9727630615234375
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	3543.4372558593750000
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	13483.0507812500000000
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	25.2859134674072266
what is there of good to be expected	519.1104736328125000
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	64.7578353881835938
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	891.3260498046875000
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	112830.0859375000000000
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it	2539.0390625000000000
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	300.2815246582031250
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	421.7676391601562500
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied	14.7330894470214844
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied	2555.9592285156250000
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	203.3008270263671875
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	333.6071777343750000
an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles	7.7073202133178711
i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing	1255.7993164062500000
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows	69.0589523315429688
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	63.2764587402343750
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	829.6112670898437500
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	1907.1445312500000000
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	54.9536323547363281
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well	9.9083995819091797
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business	55.7639579772949219
a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	17.1100158691406250
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	329.1872253417968750
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	344.7413330078125000
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	36.9455642700195312
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	1578.1046142578125000
as they went down stairs together charlotte said	76.7820892333984375
mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	12551.4267578125000000
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them	892.7459106445312500
he was on one side of her mother	869.1420288085937500
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	18995.9687500000000000
her ease and good spirits increased	250.1244964599609375
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	38.6710319519042969
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	2800.7741699218750000
which do you mean	86.0093383789062500
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	66.3384017944335938
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	358.5611267089843750
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	144.5653991699218750
her answer was warmly in his favour	1130.2414550781250000
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	18934.5117187500000000
in that case he would return no more	108.3254013061523438
did charlotte dine with you	160.3936309814453125
by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	14465.1464843750000000
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small	34.9176368713378906
of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	153.2779998779296875
a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment	3636.3103027343750000
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	10.8664665222167969
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	1733.2005615234375000
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	1082.6591796875000000
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	74.3419113159179688
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	4826.9809570312500000
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him	40.5583152770996094
elizabeth almost stared at her	1615.8664550781250000
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	923.1279296875000000
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	38583.0312500000000000
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	13.8639049530029297
oh mr collins	932.3875122070312500
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	35.9997444152832031
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	12869.2119140625000000
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	29.7012214660644531
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	5801.5483398437500000

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration	127.2757492065429688
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	47.1228561401367188
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	349.2337646484375000

she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet	1961.7487792968750000

to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	1251.9071044921875000
elizabeth looked surprised	23.5453987121582031
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	955.2351074218750000
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	373.2702941894531250
on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must	66.6517333984375000

i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance	335.6716613769531250
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	98.5117263793945312
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	248.6042938232421875
but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	15656.7138671875000000
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	8340.0449218750000000
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	47.7487716674804688
i have already told her so once by your desire	33627.2148437500000000
i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	20.8815650939941406
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	33.0814628601074219
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself	30.6051959991455078

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	396.2569274902343750
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	34.8830337524414062
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	216.7622070312500000
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	10368.9453125000000000
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	467.3500671386718750
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	215.3611450195312500
i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me	59.6415901184082031
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father	2913.5344238281250000
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room	1577.2899169921875000
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	6612.4726562500000000
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world	144.0501403808593750
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	62.5284996032714844
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said	1161.4782714843750000
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal	13134.1523437500000000
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	395.5186462402343750
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed	2932.8566894531250000
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	4554.8129882812500000
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	582.0620727539062500
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	25.0768070220947266
it was over at last however	84151.8984375000000000
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	8484.4384765625000000
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	2624.4689941406250000
my dear sir	1415.0861816406250000
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	498.3999633789062500
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you	11.6130342483520508
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	94.3272933959960938
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	772.3644409179687500
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	2440.0393066406250000
i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do	7893.5078125000000000
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	1183.8912353515625000
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	206.2348785400390625
he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	85.4169540405273438
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	954.6832275390625000
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	12249.9785156250000000
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	40.0445709228515625
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	14.1900272369384766
my dear friend	26.9734935760498047
miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	53.7182464599609375
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	370.6447448730468750
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	114.1866531372070312
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	105.8556137084960938
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	72.3625335693359375
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this	1042.2058105468750000
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	2019.7523193359375000
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	23.6073951721191406

this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	17.9514255523681641
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	125.6638565063476562

when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	86.9628295898437500

on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	34.3526039123535156
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you	1187.1925048828125000
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	2494.1552734375000000
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name	9.6074237823486328
elizabeth made no answer	61.1741180419921875
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	26281.4980468750000000
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	2404.0192871093750000
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	33.0545082092285156
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	885.1912841796875000
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	4839.0429687500000000
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	235.2396240234375000
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table	1843.6343994140625000
he made no answer	3057.0961914062500000
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	103.5240936279296875
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	159.5869445800781250
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	4.1545453071594238
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	22026.7597656250000000
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	318.8325500488281250
it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	15.2194328308105469
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	1065.7445068359375000
the envelope itself was likewise full	220.6965332031250000
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	12304.9628906250000000
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	10.2880754470825195
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	6.2118186950683594
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2657.2043457031250000
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	3863.1320800781250000
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature	10.2981424331665039
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	325.3044433593750000
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	221.5634765625000000
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	20.6945590972900391
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	5899.0161132812500000
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins	3521.6203613281250000
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	11.6050500869750977
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	18.8720626831054688
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	783.6940307617187500
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	313.5563659667968750
mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	3844.1496582031250000
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy	1491.1394042968750000
elizabeth was forced to go	229.6365051269531250
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	528.4882202148437500
the supposition did not pain her	8919.9404296875000000
she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy	23.0328235626220703
mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks	8117.9736328125000000
invented by m rs bell <num> charlotte street bedford square	2872.3393554687500000
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it	144.9389648437500000
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	36.9901695251464844
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility	61.6735267639160156
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane	32.6574745178222656
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	730.1129150390625000
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	16.3889255523681641
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	669.4282836914062500
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment	697.4148559570312500
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy	68.5933914184570312
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	52.5025978088378906
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	336.8999938964843750
what should not you mind	81.9300384521484375
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence	13856.8544921875000000
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	330.9958496093750000
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	1438.9335937500000000
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	57.0846176147460938
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	87.9421234130859375
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	39.0169525146484375
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him	39.6676330566406250
she could think only of her letter	2159.6274414062500000
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	65.7659912109375000
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	50.3712997436523438
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	5.5257892608642578
cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress	144.2116546630859375
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could	18926.3886718750000000
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	598.2060546875000000
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	7430.8671875000000000
jane was by no means better	490.7174682617187500
she answered him with cold civility	309.8371276855468750
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	10.2536048889160156
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	141.2836303710937500
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	704.7410278320312500
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	3589.2531738281250000
this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue	3474.0957031250000000
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	9.7983255386352539
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	12.0390911102294922
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	1272.4212646484375000
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	15.9194459915161133
pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family	100.3089904785156250
yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world	47.5867881774902344
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	1854.7363281250000000
and she rose as she spoke	147.7766113281250000
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	7.3694891929626465
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	216.2302398681640625
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	72994.3437500000000000
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again	19.7597217559814453
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	121.0426025390625000
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile	9.7268619537353516
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	24.1568717956542969
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	85.0933609008789062
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved	42737.7968750000000000
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more	230.5558319091796875
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	93.6162948608398438
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	131.0203094482421875
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end	248.8167114257812500
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	18.3725662231445312
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	2528.9750976562500000
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	64.1928253173828125
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	14325.1191406250000000
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	193.4345703125000000
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	113.3141021728515625
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	2550.3200683593750000
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	74.5620880126953125
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	158.5617370605468750
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy	2387.2272949218750000
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	15095.5341796875000000
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	9101.4150390625000000
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility	5354.5244140625000000
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise	20791.6054687500000000
i am trying to make it out	580.1456909179687500
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	139.8225097656250000
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	103.5841827392578125

they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	21548.7519531250000000
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	1492.7863769531250000
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within that sum	1437.1444091796875000
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	51.1572723388671875
a few weeks he believed	12.8536615371704102
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	2968.7927246093750000
such as vanity and pride	70.9502334594726562
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	92.8098526000976562
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	309.8371276855468750
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	131.9127960205078125
i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	1454.6315917968750000

from mr collins and what can he have to say	69018.5703125000000000
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	123.6698455810546875
or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy	164.3160705566406250
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	1887.7346191406250000
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	2979.5639648437500000

her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	406.3234863281250000
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	4280.1401367187500000
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	146.3597717285156250
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	174.0366668701171875
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	800.7896728515625000
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	744.5919189453125000
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	8794.1455078125000000

it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now	640.1025390625000000
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	47.8005447387695312
but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	47.8843307495117188
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	5066.6909179687500000
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	81.2401351928710938

cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	12.7104187011718750
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone	1134.6813964843750000

did you go by the village of kympton	20.5706863403320312
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	16.7805194854736328
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence	376.9609985351562500
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said	32.3563537597656250
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	418.6412963867187500
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	362.9218139648437500
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	68.8566665649414062
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	65.1958847045898438

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	5250.4228515625000000
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley	11789.2421875000000000
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	5858.9399414062500000
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	125.6692504882812500
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	22.6523628234863281
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	1553.5753173828125000
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	2463.5144042968750000
my dearest lizzy	2936.1674804687500000
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	183.6701202392578125
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them	19492.2695312500000000
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	46.1211471557617188
yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor	3204.9035644531250000
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	1259.7276611328125000
but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	157.8534393310546875
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	29.6854686737060547
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	36.5085525512695312
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	13040.9423828125000000
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library	41.2796707153320312
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	57489.8085937500000000
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	577.7385253906250000
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	5917.1469726562500000
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	928.1849365234375000
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	501.4703979492187500
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	16913.9375000000000000
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	402.8578186035156250
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	92.0771942138671875
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	395.5186462402343750
wickham only shook his head	106.0401153564453125
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am	2557.8684082031250000
mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	21.4825210571289062
to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	30.4420795440673828
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me	1241.9858398437500000
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	199.9191436767578125
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend	116.2945785522460938
their reception at home was most kind	226.2013092041015625
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	2167.5246582031250000
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	686.1753540039062500
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in laws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	80.7066116333007812
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals	2864.3967285156250000
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says	76.4653930664062500
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	105.3876800537109375
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune	22.5730800628662109
mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	108.9892196655273438
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	1091.4008789062500000
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	764.0372314453125000
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	3631.3615722656250000
the path just admitted three	90426.1328125000000000
if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	25.2195720672607422
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	172.8454895019531250
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	690.1780395507812500
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself	991735.6875000000000000
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	168.3581237792968750
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	1169.0989990234375000
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	26.3576488494873047
oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle	1090.5539550781250000
miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	1998.9361572265625000
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	13.9501123428344727
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	2557.5783691406250000
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	67.1014938354492188
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	64.0344924926757812
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself	297.3744506835937500
i will make no promise of the kind	507.3007507324218750
oh jane take care	325.7878417968750000
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	46.4709777832031250
i did not know before that you ever walked this way	38.6370620727539062
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	1612.1715087890625000
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	211.8092803955078125
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful	8174.3828125000000000
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	97.5968170166015625
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	202.7491912841796875
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	48.6490402221679688
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	61.6402740478515625
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	2483.3547363281250000
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	158.7013702392578125
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	1365.5520019531250000
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	720892.9375000000000000
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	42.4023590087890625
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	10294.5839843750000000
do you prefer reading to cards	43.8996200561523438
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	34921.9804687500000000
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	22.9575443267822266
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	40.0732231140136719
i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself	192.1365661621093750
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	28.7378997802734375
<num> d the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	692.5599365234375000
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	1036.8762207031250000
mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	1533.2302246093750000
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	359.4643554687500000
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent	100.2439727783203125
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	103.7036895751953125
lady catherine seemed resigned	294.9423522949218750
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well	353.2281188964843750
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	33.4995269775390625
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	11713.4160156250000000
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	159.0308837890625000
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	859.9039306640625000
the second began	1997.8431396484375000
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	457.8034973144531250
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	6985.8544921875000000
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	83.0211563110351562
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	12300.8095703125000000
no one made any reply	1521.5147705078125000
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	257.8120727539062500
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	706.9964599609375000
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under	139.7626647949218750
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	113.4201049804687500
come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance	127.7098083496093750
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	304.7015075683593750
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone	11416.6132812500000000
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	18.2467021942138672
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	39.1097030639648438
my dear dear lydia	40.6157684326171875
it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows	205.9674530029296875
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	33.8250160217285156
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	2299.7182617187500000
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	115.9292068481445312
now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	2516.6208496093750000
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	668.5394897460937500
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	332.2140502929687500
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened	32.9629287719726562
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	40684.8164062500000000
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	1241.9858398437500000
they followed her into the dining parlour	1518.9248046875000000
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	361.3657836914062500
sir william did not say much	35.1665992736816406
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	3241.1765136718750000
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	5944.0239257812500000
i had much rather go in the coach	11418.9775390625000000
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	34010.3632812500000000
it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	1591.0909423828125000
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate	115.5899047851562500
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	123.7346115112304688
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	23090.9804687500000000
i must not decide on my own performance	382.8912353515625000
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	14.8011274337768555
he shook his head	538.8721313476562500
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	276.4081726074218750
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	20.0782585144042969
i can guess the subject of your reverie	5066.6909179687500000
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	11873.1884765625000000
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	106.2041625976562500
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	723.0263061523437500
good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	101.9785919189453125
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions	1165.3728027343750000
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	24.6799678802490234
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	3318.5385742187500000
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	561.7034912109375000
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	335.3683471679687500
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	1082.6591796875000000
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	183.2311859130859375
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	20.5735416412353516
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	5831.0576171875000000
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them	124.0105819702148438
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	139.0069122314453125
he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	760.9185180664062500
gracechurch street sept <num>	8.2809190750122070
what do you mean	389.1580200195312500
at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	74.0603408813476562
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	150.1474151611328125
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	3447.7868652343750000
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	1851.9252929687500000
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	6164.6181640625000000
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly	1369.0238037109375000
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	268.9523925781250000
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	6.9174799919128418
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	14.9466724395751953
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet	102.6509323120117188
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	36.9801368713378906
however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <url> you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form	33.8094978332519531
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation	24393.4941406250000000
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said	687.0327758789062500
do you certainly leave kent on saturday	62.1127395629882812
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this	128.2166748046875000
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture	13.7333803176879883
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility	2369.2619628906250000
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	49863.0546875000000000
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know	86.8117752075195312
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk	167.4053344726562500
from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	273.2350769042968750
do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	12194.5781250000000000
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children	5084.3774414062500000
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	65.7801742553710938
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	54.9520034790039062
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	164.1028594970703125
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	23.9449272155761719
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	116.5563278198242188
that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	698.0297241210937500
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers	52.6433067321777344
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	90.4333801269531250
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	64.6904067993164062
does that young lady know mr darcy	101.0230560302734375
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	13.7279357910156250
she replied in the affirmative	246.0519561767578125
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	2047.2103271484375000
her ladyship was highly incensed	140.7545013427734375
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	913.5957031250000000
did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	1038.0703125000000000
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	51.6188163757324219
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	418.6412963867187500
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	2870.2553710937500000
mr bingley followed his advice	113.0708847045898438
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	30482.5351562500000000
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	215.7301177978515625
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	447.7503051757812500
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	16222.7529296875000000
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man	3428.3041992187500000
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	53.5362510681152344
none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	658.4393920898437500
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	3812.8486328125000000
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	893.9224853515625000
she declared her resolution	183.4907684326171875
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	7831.5942382812500000
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	219.6320037841796875
you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	5737.5800781250000000
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	65.5185012817382812
i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	11373.4277343750000000
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	1294.8659667968750000
project gutenberg tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u s unless a copyright notice is included	25.1630420684814453
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	27674.3164062500000000
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	382.1947937011718750
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed	2913.5344238281250000
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	755.7493286132812500
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	2722.2902832031250000
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	121.1252899169921875
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	54.5265007019042969
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	15.6162462234497070
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	49.7426719665527344
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	1086.1354980468750000
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	592.5004882812500000
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	3884.4108886718750000
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st	86.4928665161132812
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	728.2867431640625000
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him	664.3973388671875000
she went on	224.5877685546875000
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family	29.8420257568359375
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	33.8798522949218750
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	724.8713378906250000
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	1992.1126708984375000
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends	16.8649425506591797
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	349.3616943359375000
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will think no more about him	311.0866088867187500
this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	690.1780395507812500
information about the mission of project gutenberg tm	73.0357360839843750
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	2200.0012207031250000
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	168.9001617431640625
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	601.9819946289062500
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said	22165.8183593750000000
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long	635.1118774414062500
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much	4090.7961425781250000
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	293.6763916015625000
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	882.6051025390625000
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	17955.9902343750000000
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	2857.9272460937500000
repeated miss bingley	465.8171081542968750
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	211.1364898681640625
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	62.3102149963378906
yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	3440.2160644531250000
what could become of mr bingley and jane	13.0037212371826172
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	243.6462707519531250
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	66.2207641601562500
illustration morning dress	183280.5781250000000000
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	83.5406188964843750
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	436.0454101562500000
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	7722.2001953125000000
i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks	4449.9882812500000000
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	49.9075546264648438
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	7.4150509834289551
oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	48.2087516784667969
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	160.2523651123046875
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	30.4363746643066406
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	131329.0625000000000000
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again	178.6844329833984375
yes but he seemed to like his second better	173.9823150634765625
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	475.4593200683593750
elizabeth silently attended her	70.6626663208007812
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	46.1223373413085938
mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	850.3153686523437500
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	540.7139892578125000
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	585.4625244140625000
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	24760.6269531250000000
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	1527.1704101562500000
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	13157.5087890625000000
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	134.8592987060546875
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do	195.5682373046875000
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	4131.8715820312500000
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	2060.5773925781250000
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	10201.7275390625000000
but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence	44.0582733154296875
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with	272.0182800292968750
indeed i do not dare	3656.0541992187500000
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before	7571.4462890625000000
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	11.5428762435913086
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	272.0683593750000000
she dared not even mention that gentleman	700.3731689453125000
he begged pardon for having displeased her	1561.2073974609375000
you were mr bingleys first choice	100.3344879150390625
repeated mr bennet	296.9204711914062500
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever	432.6438293457031250
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	509.6783752441406250
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	73.3092803955078125
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	98.5117263793945312
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice	7543.9423828125000000
elizabeth was distressed	140.5611267089843750
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	1684.4147949218750000
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	71.6246032714843750
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding	752.9326171875000000
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	49.2691688537597656
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	20.2898960113525391
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	12.3442077636718750
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	1265.3410644531250000
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	322.8807983398437500
no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	1128.1254882812500000
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	707.0870971679687500
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	2115.8041992187500000
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	22.7532196044921875
mr bennet treated the matter differently	259.7377319335937500
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	1720.9029541015625000
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	4266.7280273437500000
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	27.1244373321533203
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	26239.2714843750000000
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	16.8536720275878906
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	330.9958496093750000
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeths intimate friend	1739.6181640625000000
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	26180.0351562500000000
oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	27.8335380554199219
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	170.3209838867187500
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	3365.1289062500000000
there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	48.4385986328125000
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution	19.5983848571777344
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	524.4534912109375000
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	123.9424819946289062
cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest	210.6138153076171875
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work	742.6194458007812500
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived	10.0241622924804688
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	546.4177856445312500
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	30.9865112304687500
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	10.0915861129760742
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips	20108.6816406250000000
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	28907.6074218750000000
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	986.9476928710937500
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	277.9248657226562500
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd	4465.4155273437500000
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	20.8308753967285156
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them	984.0511474609375000
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	1082.4986572265625000
my dear brother	263.6848754882812500
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	280.6734313964843750
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	913.5957031250000000
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	32301.1875000000000000
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	92.5447463989257812
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	3486.2597656250000000
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	180.3700714111328125
i should like it beyond any thing	173.0832672119140625
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	2331.1699218750000000
yes she did	351.6351318359375000
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained	131.8572082519531250
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	88.4066314697265625
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	7898.6958007812500000
you are too hasty sir she cried	47.8631362915039062
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	45.8818817138671875
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence	2466.9587402343750000
yes almost every day	30.2527275085449219
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num> f<num>	1533.2302246093750000
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	385.9353027343750000
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	219.3336334228515625
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	2399.9807128906250000
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	103.7463150024414062
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal	20876.2265625000000000
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	162.4826812744140625
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	65.0893325805664062
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	1249.9351806640625000
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	412.2375183105468750
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	172.0572357177734375
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would	47.0130043029785156
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said	4532.4667968750000000
these were the contents	62.2282638549804688
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	28043.6113281250000000
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	56.3506813049316406
elizabeth felt janes pleasure	2806.6579589843750000
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	52292.9765625000000000
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together	45.0422630310058594
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh	25.1252040863037109
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	219.4331207275390625
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	511.4429626464843750
i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcys	3282.9523925781250000
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	121.4988479614257812
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	37.1876564025878906
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	49.6026916503906250
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	25.5039501190185547
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	422.2872619628906250
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	829.3699951171875000
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	418.6412963867187500
lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	20608.3320312500000000
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	3618.9848632812500000
jane shook her head	83.5406188964843750
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	20.9698219299316406
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	523.2073364257812500
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	6269.1479492187500000
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	68.5897903442382812
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	11721.5390625000000000
he bore it however with admirable calmness	51.5186462402343750
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself	760.4774780273437500
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr darcy	3848.8562011718750000
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	7357.1303710937500000
i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife	3843.8452148437500000
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	3878.0520019531250000
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	12562.7070312500000000
by the author of sense and sensibility	760.9185180664062500
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <num> e<num>	21.8855915069580078
and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case	1925.9621582031250000
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible	7.0812559127807617
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	5284.7138671875000000
oh where where is my uncle	1506.2911376953125000
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	1552.2003173828125000
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	169.4020080566406250
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	38125.0546875000000000
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	13.2484512329101562
and have you answered the letter	12866.9541015625000000
said he hastily as he opened the door	115.4720077514648438
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	56.3009910583496094
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	117.3071060180664062
and is this all	2821.8742675781250000
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	63.4064559936523438
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	1095.2917480468750000
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home	11346.8417968750000000
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	13062.6875000000000000
and you saw him frequently	4807.7631835937500000
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	2079.3867187500000000
said he as he joined her	60.7939643859863281
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you	723.0263061523437500
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	115.3288269042968750
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	2023.2996826171875000
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	24.3438434600830078
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	41.9296569824218750
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	71.0209045410156250
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	31.0152187347412109
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection	60764.9023437500000000
jane looked at her doubtingly	5153.9848632812500000
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	2233.3200683593750000
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	62.2827110290527344
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	67.7383499145507812
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	32.7931175231933594
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	34.6614570617675781
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	48.4816093444824219
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time	28.1640338897705078
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point	559.5693359375000000
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	1385.8989257812500000
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	683.6602783203125000
is my father in town	118.1739425659179688
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tms goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come	30.2939128875732422
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	30.4381446838378906
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	478.6720275878906250
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is <num>	66.6991043090820312
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	7235.4809570312500000
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	98.5117263793945312
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west salt lake city ut <num> <num> <num>	269.6797790527343750
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	3487.1308593750000000
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months	365.5961303710937500
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	160.4546051025390625
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet	17.8905353546142578
the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	17961.4726562500000000
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	70.7465515136718750
she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	30716.0175781250000000
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	308.1924438476562500
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	58.0602073669433594
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth	23160.2968750000000000
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	58.0004081726074219
jane now came up	2762.5585937500000000
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	395.5186462402343750
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	45211.7539062500000000
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	1417.9569091796875000
cried elizabeth when she had finished	11558.1865234375000000
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost	6327.2421875000000000
you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	60.3887252807617188
by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	1882.9879150390625000
charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture	10.5272703170776367
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	402.9435424804687500
very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	80.2015533447265625
yes in conjunction with his friend	46.3539161682128906
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	418.6412963867187500
cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way	35.4451446533203125
how so how can it affect them	1011.2084960937500000
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	371.0422973632812500
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	43.5205154418945312
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	14.6851625442504883
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	27369.1210937500000000
i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	6194.0429687500000000
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	12403.7783203125000000
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	1372.6622314453125000
it was then disclosed in the following manner	106.3307495117187500
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home	10.5750999450683594
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	7.6596183776855469
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	398.0638122558593750
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said	375.9204406738281250
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	67.5561294555664062
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	38.2022628784179688
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am	40.8373413085937500
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	253.1268463134765625
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	4210.7094726562500000
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both	382.1947937011718750
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation	13.6074876785278320
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	400.8940429687500000
mr collins made his declaration in form	856.1423339843750000
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil	63.1096801757812500
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty	25.6361083984375000
come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	92303.2500000000000000
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	573.7227172851562500
darcy mentioned his letter	181.1726531982421875
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley	203.3008270263671875
she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her	38.4829177856445312
it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	10.0033025741577148
how can you be smiling so lizzy	822.4508666992187500
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	112.5950469970703125
it was all pride and insolence	232.9098052978515625
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther	92.7867126464843750
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject	18.7510433197021484
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	3325.1530761718750000
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	6001.7714843750000000
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	703.0396118164062500
updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed	4726.8750000000000000
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	517.6069335937500000
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	7939.5078125000000000
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	2994.4978027343750000
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence	6895.6821289062500000
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	98.1403961181640625
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	7279.0209960937500000
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	45.8995819091796875
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	54.9452438354492188
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	149.8356628417968750
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now	4280.1401367187500000
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	26.4692554473876953
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	94.0193710327148438
project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers	31.7943801879882812
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	945.4939575195312500
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	34.2648277282714844
his doing so drew her notice	100.2199783325195312
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	90.5177154541015625
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	2200.5742187500000000
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	900.5396728515625000
the letter was to this effect	222.7563934326171875
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	12.8883552551269531
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	17.2961578369140625
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	2038.6920166015625000
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	79.1940460205078125
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	457.3850097656250000
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	4447.9643554687500000
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	9140.9677734375000000
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	2601.7343750000000000
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	94.9675216674804688
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair	3791.1950683593750000
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families	256.7591857910156250
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	49.1258239746093750
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	112.2418441772460938
what could be the meaning of it	13.0332698822021484
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	323.6026000976562500
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	62.5176849365234375
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	26.3573246002197266
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite	698.3339843750000000
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge	1438.5540771484375000
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	129.8166809082031250
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	1150.7581787109375000
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	58.3903770446777344
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases	501.4703979492187500
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	10438.2880859375000000
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	102.3715362548828125
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	3126.1689453125000000
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	18.5194511413574219
both changed colour one looked white the other red	3054.1997070312500000
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	373.2702941894531250
her reflections were in general satisfactory	30.1540756225585938
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	12698.7988281250000000
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	209.3799438476562500
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	24.4668064117431641
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	127.4889450073242188
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	9.1622819900512695
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	1575.2064208984375000
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	98.5117263793945312
but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	108.5678710937500000
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	333.5303649902343750
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	5663.9790039062500000
mr bennet replied that he had not	13.8793392181396484
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	37.3792304992675781
i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	1112.7415771484375000
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	10454.4863281250000000
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin	615.2053222656250000
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	77313.8671875000000000
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	200.3649139404296875
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	28.4425239562988281
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	105.8382949829101562
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	19965.0625000000000000
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	445.0970153808593750
i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better	4892.7045898437500000
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	2921.3850097656250000
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	8.7084369659423828
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	15147.9257812500000000
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	1825.8533935546875000
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	203.0475769042968750
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	32.9456939697265625
i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	90.8721160888671875
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	14.1928339004516602
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	2447.4597167968750000
<num> b project gutenberg is a registered trademark	3461.6606445312500000
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	15.4831905364990234
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	10028.0400390625000000
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	30.2908382415771484
perfectly so i thank you	416.7660522460937500
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus	26.7229785919189453
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	197.7962036132812500
this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	11453.6923828125000000
sir william only smiled	172.5325927734375000
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	1593.1029052734375000
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	539.5787353515625000
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	2055.6992187500000000
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	11.7133340835571289
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added	92.0776824951171875
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	1667.0371093750000000
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	59.5887145996093750
end of the second volume	97.5546569824218750
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	29.1573390960693359
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	2747.1315917968750000
other schemes too came into her head	205.0485687255859375
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	14.5417022705078125
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	97.1095275878906250
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	129.6981048583984375
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	49.2664833068847656
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	116.6791687011718750
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	14.0382547378540039
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness	593.2349853515625000
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	2476.7678222656250000
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	147.8704376220703125
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	299.5278930664062500
i should imagine not	1961.7487792968750000
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	429.1817932128906250

the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	363.4949035644531250
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation	1189.5205078125000000
elizabeth was delighted	14502.5791015625000000
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit	382.1947937011718750
when this was done she had a less active part to play	146.2577667236328125
i am dear sir c c	309.8371276855468750
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	77.8982086181640625
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	2623.0017089843750000
said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	164.9110565185546875
of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	44.6907958984375000
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	411.9074096679687500
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	127.0728988647460938
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	2895.3645019531250000
if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	21.6126728057861328
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	79.7656326293945312
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	720.6829223632812500
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	50.1228218078613281
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	4649.1821289062500000
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	1769.4719238281250000
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	1010.7062377929687500
it was gratitude	269.7884521484375000
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	10789.3730468750000000
i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	5075.1054687500000000
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	955.9007568359375000
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	395.5186462402343750
mr bennet protested against any description of finery	823.4877319335937500
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town	42.4847412109375000
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	67.4987258911132812
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does	892.7978515625000000
oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps	30.9763336181640625
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	508.8842468261718750
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	27.5417728424072266
but what is to be done about pemberley	98.5117263793945312
the loo table however did not appear	104.5919265747070312
i never heard that it was	715.0244140625000000
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	69.7530593872070312
a man who had felt less might	38.2785263061523438
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	5683.0517578125000000
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	799.5412597656250000
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	4407.8608398437500000
how could you begin	42.6279869079589844
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	22371.2851562500000000
said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	14.0399322509765625
but self though it would intrude could not engross her	106.3147277832031250
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	14.5559272766113281
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	2634.8039550781250000
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	50.8379898071289062
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused	608.0762329101562500
i have sir	11.8933773040771484
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said	37.6072578430175781
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	56.8476982116699219
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	165.1422576904296875
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	41.7386283874511719
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	101.1603469848632812
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	3355.5981445312500000
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	146.6675872802734375
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear	83.0537872314453125
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	8290.2363281250000000
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	43.6268577575683594
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	71.1886367797851562
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study	707.5249023437500000
jamess had made him courteous	303.0478210449218750
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	45.9722366333007812
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	2966.6049804687500000
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	2554.1704101562500000
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	3343.3574218750000000
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks	355.9180603027343750
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	232.3628845214843750
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	22916.3125000000000000
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course	24483.2695312500000000
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	5713.6254882812500000

indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	3705.1738281250000000
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	10073.4736328125000000
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	6881.7407226562500000
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	307.8901367187500000
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	3354.4780273437500000
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	21.3247241973876953
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	29.3389663696289062
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	393.5419921875000000
the foundations principal office is located at <num> melan dr s fairbanks ak <num> but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations	36.2414703369140625
my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	113.1109008789062500
i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	262.0833740234375000
she directly replied	1206.4058837890625000
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	728.6041870117187500
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	80.0013732910156250
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character	15.4831981658935547
oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you	87.2265472412109375
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out	47878.6171875000000000
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	6.6942763328552246
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	168.8716430664062500
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	740.1582641601562500
the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	1031.3416748046875000
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	3700.0571289062500000
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	6744.7954101562500000
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	88.4500579833984375
in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	7303.2885742187500000
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	6900.1352539062500000
if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever	14123.1767578125000000
illustration a vicarage house	439.6520996093750000
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	3577.2963867187500000
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	5490.9843750000000000
is he married or single	629.4937133789062500
said he smiling	71.4589462280273438
elizabeth could bear it no longer	203.3008270263671875
you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	698.7626953125000000
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	6835.6079101562500000
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	5980.9560546875000000
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	3019.8381347656250000
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	35.7787742614746094
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	17776.0683593750000000
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered	47.8533477783203125
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	145.8027954101562500
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	30.8123569488525391
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	1071.4584960937500000
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	3902.6982421875000000
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	100.0996704101562500

by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	16.8102874755859375
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	3461.6606445312500000
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	2483.4353027343750000
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out	22018.7792968750000000
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	14.4438543319702148
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	616.1653442382812500
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys	7131.6318359375000000

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	5837.1445312500000000
yes very handsome	15.2213153839111328
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	21785.3417968750000000
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	10826.7470703125000000
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	4482.2089843750000000
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	1668.4207763671875000
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	24.8487892150878906
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	908.6853027343750000
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	3710.6408691406250000
i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	7086.3168945312500000
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	241.4044036865234375
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	13.3218441009521484
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	92.3100967407226562
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	65.6302108764648438
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	16.8043231964111328
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	45.9737815856933594
mrs collins knew not what to make of him	1147.3912353515625000
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	37.3728485107421875
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	70.2841110229492188
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	84.1954803466796875
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	88.5980529785156250
as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	2210.2375488281250000
yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	3838.5632324218750000
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	11252.1640625000000000
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange	5201.2485351562500000
you provide in accordance with paragraph <num> f<num> a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <num> days of receipt of the work	127.0879821777343750
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	59.5674667358398438
she was gone directly	41.2415962219238281
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	602.2421264648437500
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	130.4387817382812500
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	139.4022521972656250
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia	529.2154541015625000
is that his design in settling here	309.8371276855468750
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged	48.1979446411132812
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	54.8825607299804688
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable	433.7748107910156250
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she	3953.3479003906250000
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	66.8883514404296875
said elizabeth to herself	55.9796180725097656
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	259.5493164062500000
they were to be off as soon as possible	48.6529388427734375
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long	590.3763427734375000
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	3171.1079101562500000
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	34.7846107482910156
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	51.8794212341308594
well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	193.1331787109375000
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	36.6820411682128906
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	1267.1075439453125000
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other	9.6857786178588867
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	20.4732952117919922
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it	84.3238906860351562
i am talking of possibilities charles	1978.6922607421875000
i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller	117.4535293579101562
so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling	125.6607437133789062
what is it you mean	273.3531188964843750
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it	440.0583801269531250
that is a failing indeed	380.5611877441406250
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	692.5599365234375000
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	69.9194564819335938
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	80.0909957885742188
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	8.0177774429321289
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	1843.8435058593750000
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	2632.4555664062500000
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	146.2577667236328125
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	3407.5637207031250000
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	18.3044357299804688
my dear jane	4325.0541992187500000
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said	37.9997100830078125

he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	29885.9648437500000000
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	996.3746337890625000
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case	224.9972229003906250
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	800.8522949218750000
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself	4343.8256835937500000
<num> e unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg	2388.5581054687500000
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	1084.3801269531250000
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	4985.0102539062500000
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	65.5754776000976562
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	316.4797973632812500
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	521.1171264648437500
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses	98.5117263793945312
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	405.1240539550781250
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference	47.5043220520019531
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet	12.6815872192382812
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	59.8769645690917969
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	40659.0234375000000000
but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	4091.6042480468750000
said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	62.2381744384765625
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you	59.4334678649902344
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	6787.7583007812500000
she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife	5564.6928710937500000
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	4816.5844726562500000
then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	415.5680541992187500
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	23.3408737182617188
can it be possible that he will marry her	42.3265876770019531
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	37.0286521911621094
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	80.5153121948242188
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	3310.4719238281250000
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	64.3451995849609375
elizabeth now began to revive	9.0341272354125977
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	8488.6308593750000000
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	43963.6015625000000000
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	14.7961273193359375
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	59.9150314331054688
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	9994.8437500000000000
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	1064.0103759765625000
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	252.9622650146484375
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	3013.8078613281250000
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	483095.1250000000000000
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	111.3498001098632812
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	89.7555465698242188
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy	31.5117607116699219
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	1206.0366210937500000
cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	32812.3281250000000000
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	6304.7685546875000000
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	6912.3398437500000000
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution	98.7180175781250000
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	9.4970865249633789
dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	1172.7562255859375000
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	9369.0976562500000000
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	245.6529235839843750
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	782.4849243164062500
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	706.6354980468750000
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	124.3465423583984375
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	3571.5456542968750000
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	459.4694824218750000
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs foot stool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <num> per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	76.4653930664062500
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	5317.5185546875000000
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	46.8721084594726562
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying	446.9951171875000000
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	1599.7552490234375000
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	152.9460906982421875
i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family	55.9741477966308594
a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	28621.5761718750000000
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her	121.9627609252929688
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	8.2930631637573242
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	1098.9951171875000000
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	77.0293731689453125
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	3018.4907226562500000
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	8124.1079101562500000
in what an amiable light does this place him	32.6974563598632812
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	192.2245178222656250
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	39.2385826110839844
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do	125.9138031005859375
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	10830.8574218750000000
it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think	12.6291074752807617
how nicely we are crammed in	52.8736495971679688
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	1738.4423828125000000
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	9.4967784881591797
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	3573.9648437500000000
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	119.4297332763671875
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance	414.8159179687500000
cried miss bingley	31.4072628021240234
let her be called down she shall hear my opinion	58.3151931762695312
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	144.2368774414062500
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets	152.6185455322265625
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	294.9089050292968750
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	76.4653930664062500
i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	8.7156333923339844
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	1407.9208984375000000
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	537.3531494140625000
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	2689.2805175781250000
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect	878.4777832031250000
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	34611.2109375000000000
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	2369.2619628906250000
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	253.2676239013671875
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well	520.5655517578125000
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	164.9756317138671875
